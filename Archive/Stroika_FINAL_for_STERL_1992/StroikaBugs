Date	ID	Who		StkVers	Pri/Sta	Description/Fix


02/11	001	Carl	02/10	5		cannot use SHIFT+button to select multiple things (must drag)
03/11		LGP		1.0d8m	FIXED

02/11	002	Carl	02/10	1		when i size something within a group, the group does not resize AND the
									handles remain visible (after deselecting) but only outside the original
									group boundaries.
							OPEN

02/11	003	Carl	02/10	1		even after i leave live mode, when i select a textedit that was selected
									while i was in live mode the blinking cursor appears.
							OPEN

02/11	004	Carl	02/10	1		cannot select an edittext to delete it (?)
							NOTREP	March 10, 1992

02/20	005	Carl	1.0d5m	1		i made a button in the english version, then renamed, resized and moved
									it in the german version. when i moved the non-customize-only version 
									(english) and checked back with the german version, it had moved it 
									(probably ok) and undid the size-to-fit (made it the same size as the
									english button).
							OPEN

02/20	006	Carl	1.0d5m	5		There's a serious usability
									issue with your customization, that involves you having to go to two (or
									three) menus to return from customize only mode to true select mode.
									that shouldn't be necessary.
									IDEA: instead of having multiple menus (gui, language) plus the "cust
									only" toggle hidden on edit menu, how about one menu called Custom, with
									first item "Customize Only" toggle, then separator, then the language
									set, then separator, then the gui set. Also, to make it easier to switch
									back to non-cust-only mode, how about having the cust-only toggle
									automatically reset the lang and gui too, rather than requiring you to
									reset them first, then come back and change cust-only.
03/11		LGP		1.0d8m	PARTIAL	-discuss with sterl

02/20	007	Simone	1.0d5m	1		Tabbing order
									How does Stroika decide the order in which views will be navigated
									via tabbing? (In Emily)
03/11		LGP		1.0d8m	PARTIAL	-user interface implemented, but no code generation?

02/20	008	Simone	1.0d5m	1		Iterators:
									Ability to start iterating at any index in the sequence.
							OPEN

02/20	009	Simone	1.0d5m	1		Ability to set up maximum number of characters per edit field (should
									beep or something if user tries to exceed limit)
03/11		LGP		1.0d8m	FIXED

02/20	010	Simone	1.0d5m	1		Annoying field names being generated for stuff like groups or static
									fields.  (Should be anonymous various).
							OPEN

02/20	011	Simone	1.0d5m	1		Labels: show up in different color from text fields with labels.
							OPEN

02/20	012	Simone	1.0d5m	1		Shift-select doesn't work any more.
03/11		LGP		1.0d8m	FIXED

02/20	013	Simone	1.0d5m	1		Preferences Dialog edit fields are too small
03/11		LGP		1.0d8m	FIXED

02/20	014	Simone	1.0d5m	1		Preferences Header file does not scroll (how can I edit it???)
03/11		LGP		1.0d8m	OPEN

02/21	015	Carl	1.0d5m	5		i don't think the accelerators (for copy, cut, & paste) are working
03/11		LGP		1.0d8m	FIXED

02/21	016	Carl	1.0d5m	5		i designed a screen in english, switched to spanish, and translated the
									names (popup menu selections, label, button name). then i switched to
									english again, then i turned off customize only. the spanish names
									were still there.
							OPEN

02/21	017	Carl	1.0d5m	1		when i type in a label and press return, it scrolls it out of view but
									doesn't give me any scroll bar OR feedback, but it's still there.
							OPEN

02/21	018	Carl	1.0d5m	1		Label on popup only centered? can't i justify it left or right? can't
									i get adornment on the popup?
							OPEN

02/21	019	Carl	1.0d5m	1		???
							IGNORE

02/24	020	Carl	1.0d5m	5		Attachments could be a hassle with this view thing. am i correct in 
									saying that i cannot see attachments work (in the main window) even
									in Live mode, because that is a non-shell view (i'm just trying to
									explain the state--i don't know actually WHY). do i have to go to the
									executable to see it work?
							OPEN

02/24	021	Carl	1.0d5m	1		What's the diff between attach height and attach top?
							IGNORE	Just a question, not a bug.

02/24	022	Carl	1.0d5m	1		There's this crazy oscillation that occurs sometimes. the more stuff
									(views) in the window, the more it oscillates (redraws, i assume). it's
									kinda bothersome. it occurs whenever focus returns to the Emily work
									window after being in another window (a document in another app, an
									Emily edit dialog, etc.)
									&	simone said you had fixed this (2/25).
03/11		LGP		1.0d8m	PARTIAL	Improved, but still buggy.

02/24	023	Carl	1.0d5m	1		ScaleView: nonstandard appearance (for motif). How does it work?
03/05	LGP					NOTABUG	This is just a sample "user-defined" view Sterling implemented for another
									project. It's purpose is to display a real value on some scale, and not
									to allow for user interaction. If you particularly like the widget and
									have suggestions for how we might extend it, we would be happy to oblige.
									If there is a similar motif widget, the similarity is accidental. If that
									motif widget is something you want supported, let us know the name.

02/24	024	Carl	1.0d5m	1		Annoying highlighting of text in an edittext. situation: i was in live
									mode and typed in more text than fit (wordwrap was on) so it scrolled
									down past the initial display. when i went back to select mode, it 
									selected pieces of the text on my cursor clicks (for moves of the
									text widget). this is distracting, but not serious.
							OPEN

02/24	025	Carl	1.0d5m	1		EDITTEXT:initial default should be blank, not "Edit Text"
							OPEN

02/24	026	Carl	1.0d5m	1		EDITTEXT:label does not appear
							OPEN

02/24	027	Simone	1.0d5m	1		When I run UIPrototype, if I type using SHIFT key, I cause assert failure.
03/11		LGP		1.0d8m	FIXED

02/24	028	Simone	1.0d5m	1		I wanted my Application window to have a main view associated with it. I
									do not want to have a window with a menu and nothing else in it...  It 
									seems from looking at Stroika code that Application (unlike Window) does
									not have the SetMainView or SetMainViewAndTargets methods.  My next 
									instinct was to try and prevent the Application window from Realizing 
									itself and having a child with a menu come up (ie I wanted to override 
									the Run method but it was "nonvirtual"). What should I do?
03/11		LGP		1.0d8m	PARTIAL	- stroika support in place to put menus where you want, and if no menu
									with application, the main app shell not shown.

02/24	029	Simone	1.0d5m	1		Typing DELETE seems to have the same effect as in (9).  Is this the same
									brain-dead reason why Emily does not work in your machine Lewis?  Does it
									have anything to do with Emacs set up?
03/11		LGP		1.0d8m	FIXED

02/24	030	Simone	1.0d5m	1		It seems that the long field for description in the prototype Sterling set
									up has some kind of bug:  if you keep on typing, it does not wrap around
									but instead seems to keep going to the right (after erasing text to the
									left ... -- try it)
03/11		LGP		1.0d8m	OPEN

02/25	031	Carl	1.0d5m	1		cannot select an edittext to cannot duplicate it?
							NOTREP	March 10, 1992

03/05	032	Carl	1.0d5m	1		Reported over the phone and LGP reproduced on mac (Emily 1.0d4). Put down
									pushbutton and checkbox, select the two, say group, and then save, and the
									group disapears. The code generation looked fine.??? Get back to him
									immediately with workaround. Reported workaround, and sterl fixed.
03/11		LGP		1.0d8m	FIXED

03/05	033	Carl	1.0d5m	1		I aligned left then went int to see the boudns, and found the two
									"aligned widgets" were actually off by 2 points. since this unexpected
									offset is not what i call alignment, and it aslo means i dont know
									enough info to manually align (by setting same boundaries in the edit
									boxes, which i may well wanto to do at some pointer), isnt it a bug?
							OPEN

03/06	034	Carl	1.0d5m	1		Pushbutton - when i press a button in live mode, an indentation stays around it for
									the remainder of the session (maybe even when i open it again, i 
									didnt check yet). this is tacky (looks like the "default button" notation).
							OPEN

03/06	035	Carl	1.0d5m	1		when i save, close, and retuyrn to a view, some of its items lose their
									font inheritance. this seems to happen to the same items that fail to
									internationalize (as descibed in a Customization Bug - Bug #?).
							OPEN
