<p class="DefItem">
The name <Span class="DefItemName">Led</Span> - by itself - refers to the family of all these products - class libraries, components,
and sample applications.
</p>

<p class="DefItem">
This license agreement applies to Led version 3.0.</p>
</p>




<h4>Platforms:</h4>

<p>ActiveLedIt! supports Windows 95/98/ME/2000/NT/XP.</p>






<h4>Price &amp; 30 day risk-free trial:</h4>

<p>
This license is royalty-free.  A single ActiveLedIt! license is good for a single developer.

This entitles the developer to a copy of the ActiveLedIt! binary (cab files, etc), as well
as documentation and samples.

The purchase price includes three months of <b>free support</b>. 
Additional support may be purchased separately. 
Contact Sophist Solutions, Inc (<A href="mailto:info-led@sophists.com" >info-led@sophists.com</a>) for
information on site licenses.</p>


<p>Developers are entitled to a 30 day trial period.
During this period, the developer may fully utilize ActiveLedIt! for
any purpose (subject to following restrictions).
Any time before the 30 days are up, the developer may return it
for a full refund (less a 9.1% processing fee).
If a CD has been shipped, it must be returned. Either way: any copies of the software
on your machines must be destroyed.







<h4>Limitations:</h4>
 	<p>This license does not include any of the C++ source code for ActiveLedIt!, nor
the Led C++ class library (all these may be licensed separately).
</p>






<h4>Permitted Uses:</h4>

<p>You may utilize ActiveLedIt! in any manner you see fit
(subject to the limitations outlined in this license) to build
either applications or components.</p>




<h4>Restrictions:</h4>


<p>Any work-products based on, or
incorporating ActiveLedIt must in some meaningful way give credit to
Sophist Solutions, Inc. for what parts were used. This credit may
take whatever form you deem appropriate for your use, but, for
example, a mention in your about box (if you are developing an
application that has an about box) would satisfy this
requirement. These credits to Sophist Solutions, Inc. should
include the web, and email addresses (<a
 href="http://www.sophists.com/Led/">http://www.sophists.com/Led/</a> and <A
 href="mailto:info-led@sophists.com" >info-led@sophists.com</a>). </p>


<p>ActiveLedIt! may be distributed in binary form, as part of some other product,
royalty-free.

But that license is <em>not</em> transferable.

In other words, you can freely build applications (or web sites) which are
based on ActiveLedIt!, and sell those products, and
redistribute ActiveLedIt! via those web sites.

But you <em>cannot</em> resell ActiveLedIt! in a form where others
could likewise redistribute ActiveLedIt!, thus competing directly with
my ActiveLedIt! sales. 
</p>



<p>You may not redistribute modified
binaries of ActiveLedIt!</p>



<h4>Non-transferable license and liabilities:</h4>

<p>This license is granted by Sophist
Solutions to a particular individual, and the license may not be
transferred. </p>

<p>This license does NOT grant the
right to redistribute any Led source code. Sophist Solutions,
Inc. is the sole source of Led licenses, and the sole party
allowed to distribute its sources. </p>

<p>Under no circumstances, including
negligence, shall Sophist Solutions, Inc. be liable for any
incidental, special or consequential damages that result from the
use or inability to use Led, even if Sophist Solutions, Inc. has
been advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event
shall Sophist Solutions, Inc. be liable to you for any damages,
losses and causes of action in excess of the amount paid for this
license. </p>

<p>This license constitutes the entire
agreement between the parties with respect to the use of ActiveLedIt! and
supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings regarding
such subject matter. No amendment to or notification of this
License will be binding unless in writing and signed by Sophist
Solutions, Inc. </p>





<p><b>Licensee agrees to the terms of
this license upon completed purchase request for ActiveLedIt!.</b> </p>
