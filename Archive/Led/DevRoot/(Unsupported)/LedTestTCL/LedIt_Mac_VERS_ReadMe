LedIt! Mac VERS

About LedIt!:
      LedIt! is a portable text editor, built using the Led text editor builder class library. It comes in both Macintosh and Windows versions. This is the Macintosh version.

      LedIt! supports editing very large documents (several megabytes), word wrapping, drag and drop,  style runs,  and object embedding.

About Led Text Editor Class Library:
       Led is a cross-platform C++-based class library, designed to facilitate the writing of a host of different text-editing/word-processing related applications. Led supports both Windows and the Mac. It has a cross-platform portable API, so that you can use it to easily write cross-platform applications using just one API for your text editing code. Also, it supports interface-layer classes making it fit seemlessly into popular class libraries on those platforms (right now, only MFC and Think Class Library supported, but PowerPlant coming soon). Led also has a very flexible, object-oriented, modular API, allowing you to easily customize draw behavior for special display needs.

Demo Limitations/Bugs (will be fixed by release):
  ¥  Undo support is incomplete
  ¥  Printing is WYSIWYG (should be sized to a page), and does eraserect (white) calls, which ironicly produces black on many printers.
  ¥  Tabs echoed as spaces
  ¥  Drag/Drop doesn't work.
  ¥  Cannot save in cross-platform style-run, object embedding format (though we can read it). Currently just saves in 'STYL' format.
  ¥  Soon to be completely rewritten in PowerPlant.

      Please send all bug reports to info-led@sophists.com.
