<a name="AboutLedClassLib"><h4>About Led Text Editor Class Library:</h4></a>

<p>Led is a cross-platform C++-based class library, designed to facilitate the writing
of a host of different text-editing/word-processing related applications. Led supports
both Windows, MacOS, and UNIX (X-Windows). It has a cross-platform portable API, so that you can use it
to easily write cross-platform applications using just one API for your text editing code.
Also, it supports interface-layer classes making it fit seemlessly into popular class
libraries on those platforms (right now, only Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC),
PowerPlant, and Gtk (Gnome Toolkit) are supported). Led also has a very
flexible, object-oriented, modular API, allowing you to easily customize draw
behavior for special display needs.
</p>

<p>Led supports editing very large documents (several megabytes), word wrapping,
drag and drop, style runs, multi-level undo, OLE2 and OpenDoc object embedding,
custom object embedding, builtin cross-platform embedded picture display, and much more.
