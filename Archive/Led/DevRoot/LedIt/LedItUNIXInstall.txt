	Installing LedIt! for UNIX

	This binary has been built for Linux using RedHat 7.3. It has been tested
on RedHat 8.0 and RedHat 9.0. Hopefully it will also work on successive versions.

	Any problems you encounter, please send email to info-led@sophists.com.

	The installation process should be very straight-forward. The fact that you
are reading this means you have managed to unzip and untar the distribution file (a
very good start). The directory where this readme file resides should also contain
a data.tar file and a UNIXInstall.sh file. Running as root (su) - run the UNIXInstall.sh
script. You can read it all carefully, or just hit return alot.
