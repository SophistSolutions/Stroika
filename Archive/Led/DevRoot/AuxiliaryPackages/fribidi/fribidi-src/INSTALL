Simple install procedure
========================

  % gzip -cd fribidi-0.9.x.tar.gz | tar xvf - # unpack the sources
  % cd fribidi-0.9.x                          # change to the toplevel directory
  % ./configure                               # run the `configure' script
  % make                                      # build FriBidi
  % make check                                # Check that it built properly
  [ Become root if necessary ]
  % make install                              # install FriBidi


The Nitty-Gritty
================

The 'configure' script can be given a number of options to enable
and disable various features. For a complete list, type:

  ./configure --help

A few of the more important ones:

*  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
                           [ Defaults to /usr/local ]

*  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
                           [ Defaults to the value given to --prefix ]

Options can be given to the compiler and linker by setting
environment variables before running configure. A few of the more
important ones:

 CC       : The C compiler to use
 CPPFLAGS : Flags for the C preprocesser such as -I and -D
 CFLAGS   : C compiler flags

The most important use of this is to set the
optimization/debugging flags. For instance, to compile with no
debugging information at all, run configure as:

 CFLAGS=-O2 ./configure           # Bourne compatible shells (sh/bash/zsh)

or,

 setenv CFLAGS -O2 ; ./configure  # csh and variants


Installation directories
========================

The location of the installed files is determined by the --prefix
and --exec-prefix options given to configure. 

Building from CVS
=================

To make fribidi from CVS, you should run the 'bootstrap' script first, to
generate the 'configure' script. Then you can continue with the installation
procedures mentioned above.
