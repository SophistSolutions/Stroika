New in 0.10.4:

* Unicode 3.2 data files used.

New in 0.10.2:

* Rule L3 of UAX#9 implemented.  Now fribidi implements the whole Unicode
  BiDi Algorithm.

* The autogenerated table files now contain much fewer symbols, which reduces
  the relocation time of the library.

New in 0.10.1:

* fribidi.spec has been added to distribution, please use this file if you
  are going to create an RPM package from fribidi.

* Fribidi tested on sourceforge.net's compile farm.
