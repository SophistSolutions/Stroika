/*
	IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT THE C CONVERSION
	--------------------------------------
	
	o Pascal "var" parameters are converted from "var x : y" to "y *x".  This
	  means that when you see the parameter "y *x" you should be aware that
			you *cannot pass in nil*.  In future this restriction may be eased,
			especially for the attr parameter to ICGetPref.  Parameters where nil
			is legal are declared using the explicit pointer type, ie "yPtr x".

	o Strings are *Pascal* strings.  This means that they must be word aligned.
		MPW and Think C do this automatically.  The last time I check, Metrowerks
		C does not.  If it still doesn't, then IMHO it's a bug in their compiler
		and you should report it to them.

	o The canonical Internet Config interface is defined in Pascal.  These
		headers have not been thoroughly tested.  If there is a conflict between
		these headers and the Pascal interfaces, the Pascal should take precedence.
