Dear QuickTime Developers,

QuickTime 2.1 for Windows Developer Release

QuickTime 2.1 for Windows is now GM!  This release is identical to the
QuickTime for Windows 2.1b42 software so an addendum of changes is not
included.  As always, if you are a registered developer and need 
assistance please contact devsupport@applelink.apple.com.

If you plan to distribute QuickTime 2.1 for Windows, you will need to sign 
an updated addendum to your current Apple Software Distribution 
Agreement. To obtain the addendum, or a software licensing agreement, 
contact Apple Software Licencing at 1-512-919-2645 or Fax at 1-512-
919-2120.  You can also send your request to AppleLink: SW.LICENSE or the 
Internet: sw.license@applelink.apple.com.

QuickTime 2.1.1 for Windows Beta Release for Customers

The QuickTime Team is working on our next release by posting QuickTime 
for Windows 2.1.1 in beta form to the general public via our WWW site.  
Feedback will be gathered through a short term address at 
qtwbugs@quickmail.apple.com.  The final release of this version is 
expected in the early Spring of 1996.

Thanks for your continued support!
The QuickTime Team
