/*
	SplayTree is an aggressively self-adjusting binary tree. A classic splay tree always moves any found node to the top after a find or an add. This produces
	a larger number or rotations, but with non-uniform requests, the reduction in average node lookup distance can make up the lost time.

	SplayTree have the following desireable features
	fast find, add and remove. 

	ability to add more than one entry with the same key

	ability to tune splay characteristics to match usage

	support backwards and forwards iteration (technically support in-order, pre-order and post-order, plus backward iteration which is reverse in-order)

	Drawbacks:
	difficult to efficiently parallelize, because of aggresive restructuring

	somewhat sensitive to order of additions. This can temporarily make the height of a splay tree very large. But find will very quickly reduce the height, and its
	average behavior is not particularly sensitive to addition order.

	SplayTrees have less overhead than many tree structures. They require at least 2 extra links per node for children, and often additional pointer to parent 
	(not necessary but  makes some routines simpler and easier to parallelize). Overhead is thus either 2 or 3 links per node, considerably higher than SkipList (1.33), 
	but less than other tree structures that record additional information with every node.

	Splaying (restructuring to make a node be the top node) is controlled by SplayType, and can very from never (simple binary search tree) to always (classic splaytree). 
	In between SplayTree supports 3 built-in request distributions: uniform, normal, and Zipf. SplayTrees are usually not an optimal choice for uniform requests, but
	they do better with tighter request frequencies, such as normal and especially zipf. You can also set custom weights tuned to your own user's characteristics.
