# Docker Build Containers

There is no need to use this, but it can provide a quickstart to building Stroika

Just create one or more of these docker images, and run them as in:

- `make docker-images`
- `docker run -it sophistsolutionsinc/stroika-buildvm-ubuntu1804-small`
  - then inside the docker container find a ReadMe.md, and follow its instructions to build (basically clone Stroika and type make )
