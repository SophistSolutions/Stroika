	make clobber
	rm -rf Configurations
	make default-configurations
	make apply-configurations
	make project-files
	#(stop at this point and send to MSFT)
	make tests


MSFT:
	You should be able to open the Solution {root}Tests\Projects\VisualStudio.Net-2015\Stroika-Tests.sln
	
	Select the Configuraiton 
		Debug-U-64 | x64
		Release-U-64 | x64
		
	rebuild ANY of the test apps, and run into it, and see the crash reported.
	
	For shits and grins, I also included
		Debug-U-32 | Win32
		
	its the same code. But if you try that - you get no failure.


	Search for qCompilerAndStdLib_COutCErrStartupCrasher_Buggy
		{root}\Library\Sources\Stroika\Foundation\Configuration\Private\Defaults_CompilerAndStdLib_.h
		If you turn that ON, you will find the bug goes away (my workaround)
		If you turn that OFF (how I shipped to you), you will see the crash.
