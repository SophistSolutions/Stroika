Each module will be marked with a 'Status' flag, indicating how
stable the API is, and something about the implmentation quality.

- Release

  Stable and final (though nothing is ever truely final). Not reconsidering right now.
  
  Changes to these APIs will be made with extra care about backward compatability and upgrade path.

- Beta

  Ready to evaluate, and useable. API probably fairly stable for v3. 
  
  Changes to these APIs will be made with care about backward compatability and upgrade path.

- Alpha

  Just a draft API; but mostly complete and usable. Very likely to see significant
  changes.

  This is also used for APIs that are experimental, to see if they work well/make sense.

- Draft

  Outlines of items to possibly be released as part of Stroika v3, and
  possibly removed for v3, but not until the next release
