 * TODO:
 *
 *  \version    <a href="code_status.html#Alpha">Alpha</a>
 *
 *  \note   Inspired by, but fairly different from
 *          @see http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html
 *
 * Design Choice Notes:
 *
 *      o   RequestHandler::CanHandleRequest() -> bool method, or association list of PATTERN->RequestHandler?
 *
 *          We COULD either have a special RequestHandler maintaining a list of owned RequestHandler, with KEYs
 *          of patterns like with Django:
 *
 *          extra_patterns = patterns('',
 *              url(r'^reports/(?P<id>\d+)/$', 'credit.views.report', name='credit-reports'),
 *              url(r'^charge/$', 'credit.views.charge', name='credit-charge'),
 *          )
 *
 *          However, in terms of performance and flexability its not clear the regular expression matching would be any more efficent or easier to code than
 *          just having a C++ method on RequestHandler().

             *
             *      @todo need more generic matchign to fit in (maybe optional matcher that takes URL?, or even full Request).
             *
             *        NOTE - may verb match and path match each OPTIONALS in class and have maybe a LIST of THINGS we know how to match.

             *
             *       @todo NEED to support NESTED Routes (or aggregated).
             *               Key is need stuff like 'default error handling' - and just to somehow inherit/copy that.

             *         because these are usually stored in a strucutre where they wont be updated.
             *         Just be sure the HANLDER argument is safe when called from multiple threads at the same time!
