/*
 * Design Choice Notes:
 *
 *      o   RequestHandler::CanHandleRequest() -> bool method, or association list of PATTERN->RequestHandler?
 *
 *          We COULD either have a special RequestHandler maintaining a list of owned RequestHandler, with KEYs
 *          of patterns like with Django:
 *
 *          extra_patterns = patterns('',
 *              url(r'^reports/(?P<id>\d+)/$', 'credit.views.report', name='credit-reports'),
 *              url(r'^charge/$', 'credit.views.charge', name='credit-charge'),
 *          )
 *
 *          However, in terms of performance and flexability its not clear the regular expression matching would be any more efficent or easier to code than
 *          just having a C++ method on RequestHandler().
