@MODULE:    Marker
@DESCRIPTION:
        <p>Marker positions are measured in units of @'Led_tChar's - which don't
    necessarily correspond exactly to bytes or characters.</p>
        <p>A TextStore contains an array of character (Led_tChar) cells numbered from 0..n-1,
    where n is the length of the buffer. But we will rarely refer to these,
    and more often refer to Marker positions.</p>
        <p>A Marker is an abstract entity which is used to keep track of portions
    of the text. It maintains "pointers" just before, and just after character (Led_tChar)
    cells.</p>
        <p>It is IMPORTANT not to confuse Marker positions with character (Led_tChar) positions.
    They are closely related, but not identical. Marker positions are
    numbered from 0..n, where n is the length of the buffer. The marker position ALPHA,
    comes just before the character (Led_tChar) position ALPHA. In other words, the character ALPHA
    lies between marker positions ALPHA, and ALPHA+1.
<pre><code>
          (Marker m)
         /      |
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7....         (marker positions)
        |H|E|L|L|O| |W|O|R|L|D|
         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7....        (character positions)
</code></pre>
    </p>
        <p>In this example, Marker m extends from marker positions 0..4, and has a
    length of 4-0=4, and bounds the characters "HELL" (which were at character (Led_tChar)
    positions 0..3).</p>
        <p>Since there is the potential for confusion between charater positions and
    marker positions, we will opt to ALWAYS refer to Marker positions - and NEVER
    refer to character positions. This will make things much clearer (I hope).</p>
        <p>So our insert routines will, for example insert not AT a particular location, but
    just AFTER a particular marker. Similarly for deletes, etc. When you ask for
    text to be copied out of the editor into a 'C' array of characters, you will specify
    the marker position just before the first character (Led_tChar) you want copied out - and so on.</p>
        <p>The main point of markers is to keep track of particular bits of text, and to
    attatch logical attributes to them. Some of these attributes might be visible (e.g.
    Bolding) and some may not (say a hyperlink, or dictionary source marker). But these
    markers are intended to be ATTACHED to particular words (or sequences of bytes) in
    the text, and NOT to positions in the text buffer. Therefore, it is one of the principle
    functions of a marker to adjust its position values so that it can keep track of a
    particular bit of text.</p>
        <p>Here is how we define the behavior of markers and their tracking of text in the
    presence of edit operations. If text is simply changed within a marker, the marker
    doesn't move (though notification methods are called). If text is inserted to
    the left (before) a given marker, its left and right sides are adjusted by the same
    amount to the right. If text is removed from the left (before) the marker, then
    the left and right sides are adjusted the same amount to the left. If the modification -
    addition or removal - takes place to the right (after) the right side of the marker, it
    has no effect. If an insertion or removal takes place INSIDE the bounds of the left
    and right sides of the marker, the left side remains unchanged, and the right side
    is incremented by the size of the insertion or decremented by the size of the removal.
    Note: this specification counts heavily on our definition that the text changes must
    happen before or after marker positions - and cannot happen AT those positions.
    A markers size can never collapse below zero.</p>
        <p>One implication of this definition of marker updating is that once a
    markers size becomes zero, it will never be automatically increased.
    Once they contain no text, the marker can only increase in size through programatic
    intervention. For this reason (at least partly) it is likely that many classes of
    markers will destroy themselves when their size decreses to zero.</p>
        <p>Markers can also be used to do things other than mark particular bits of text. They
    can be used to insert other sorts of graphix into the flow of the text. One particular
    marker subclass might display a picture. Since this marker really has nothing todo with
    any text, it might be a zero-length marker. Even zero length markers CAN end
    up being displayed. They participate in the TextImager layout, and display.
    But, more typically, it would be a marker of length 1 (with a sentinel character in the
    character position marked by that marker), so that cursoring in the editor the image
    is treated as a single item (like a character of text).</p>
        <p>It is for this reason (and others) that we care about the ordering of markers with
    zero length.</p>
        <p>Markers have a natural ordering. They are ordered by their left hand sides start
    positions. This ordering could be further refined to take into account the
    markers right-hand sides - but that ordering would still not be a well-ordering (we
    can easily built two markers with the same left and right sides).</p>
        <p>Since we care for display purposes about the relative ordering of markers - even
    those with zero length - we require a further constraint on the ordering of markers to
    make them well-ordered. We call this the "marker sub-position order". Each marker within
    the buffer which starts at a particular location has a sub-position index from 0..m-1,
    where m is the number of other markers which start at the same position. This sub-position
    order defines precedence at display time when markers overlap, and compete in the
    TextLayout and imaging process described in the TextImager header file.</p>
