THIS snapshot is from HelathFrame (as of 2011-09-21).

I MUST review the other snapshots I have on 
	\Sandbox\Led (Dev and ARCHIVE_BACKUP_APX_2005_10_15)
	
But get all this compiling, and get it compiling on unix too.

TEHN - when it all compiles - start rebasing it ontop of Stroika-Foundation.

THEN - decide what todo about Sample apps for Led (stuff like LedIt, ActiveLedIt, etc).
