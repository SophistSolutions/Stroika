The Led framework is a collection of libraries which support text editing. This includes
code to serialize and deserialize rich text formats (such as RTF and HTML), and code to
render rich text (including RTL text, tables, etc), support for interactors (full text 
editing/word processing functionality.


History:
	THIS snapshot is from HelathFrame (as of 2011-09-21).

	I MUST review the other snapshots I have on 
		\Sandbox\Led (Dev and ARCHIVE_BACKUP_APX_2005_10_15)
	
	But get all this compiling, and get it compiling on unix too.

	TEHN - when it all compiles - start rebasing it ontop of Stroika-Foundation.

	THEN - decide what todo about Sample apps for Led (stuff like LedIt, ActiveLedIt, etc).


	(Originally from that - but then rest that was never ported to HealthFrame - I grabbed the most recent other verison of Led I could find.
	Too bad I wasn't more careful!

	Hopefully this Stroika project will make that easier going forward....

	It may take a while before I have all this building/working ... again...
