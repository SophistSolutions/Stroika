 *  TODO:
 *      @todo   Windows fRunQLength value is a point-in-time snapshot, and it SHOULD be (if we can find out how)
 *              an average over the measurement interval.
 *
 *      @todo   Consider making fTotalProcessCPUUsage and fTotalCPUUsage from Info struct - 0..N where N is numebr of CPUs.
 *              Reason is just for consistency sake with data returned in Process  module. OR - make the inverse
 *              change there? But it would be better if these were consistent.
 *
 *      @todo   GetSystemConfiguration_CPU ().GetNumberOfLogicalCores () is cached on Linux, but CAN change while running (crazy - right?)
 *              But so rare and so costly to recompute. Find a way to compromise.
 *              MAYBE the issue is differnt - hot plug cpu - CPU online/offline. Maybe total cannot change, but just number
 *              online?
 *
