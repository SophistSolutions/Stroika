/*
 * TODO:
 *      @todo   Somehow make captrueset comparable, so that we can use it as a KEY with mreasumrnes
 *              and then store latest for each captureset.
 *
 *              Then combine into one massive measuremnets list fMeasurmentsMapping.Values() (once
 *              we have impelemtend values() on mapping).
 *
 *      @todo   VERY primitive, but for simple cases functional implementation. FIX IT, so its better, and
 *              more complete (and efficient).
 *
 *      @todo   Current impl only supports one CaptureSet<>. To support more, we need a strategy to merge
 *              or handle composites.
 *
 *      @todo   make it optional storing the most recent measurement set.
 *
 *      @todo   Use threadpool CORRECTLY!. Maybe push ALL measurements into
 *              threadpool at just the right time, and then paralell process as much as the threadpool size allows.
 *              That seems the best appraoch! Default to theadpool size of one! One recurring task in threadpool
 *              would be to re-schedule rest of measurements...
