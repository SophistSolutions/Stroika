TODO

	o	Instruments to add
		o	network usage
			CONFIG - gateway, ip addr, etc
		o	uname, (os name/version), pretty name (/etc/*release)
		o	pings and traceroutes to given argument addresses)
		o	Measure WIFI signal strenght (no idea how todo this!), and maybe stuff like neighboring SSIDs
			(inSSIDer?)
		o	iostat/vmstat
		o	/proc/ /sysfs stuff - thats easy to grab
		o	A generic QueryPerformanceCounter impl
			http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms644904(v=vs.85).aspx
			But need some registry/enum of basic ones. I have no idea
			about that!

	o	Capturer code is USEABLE - but not very good (see that file for todo)
