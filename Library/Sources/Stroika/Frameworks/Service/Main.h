/**
 *
 *  \version    <a href="code_status.html#Alpha-Early">Alpha-Early</a>
 *              (note - basic functionality works on linux - start/stop/restart etc), but nothing on windoze yet.
 *
 * TODO:
 *
 *      @todo   Do a better job handling default/reasonable timeout time for service to start/stop/restart.
 *              Hacked something mostly for UNIX.
 *
 *      @todo   Window service not fully working - see why when you start/stop we dont see
 *              Logger::Get ().Log (Logger::Priority::eNotice, L"User-service code is shut down");
 *              message printed out. Basic startup/shutdown seems roughly OK though.
 *
 *      @todo   Decide if we want PIDFILE support on windows or not? Maybe not need. But also we have
 *              static  TString GetServerRunningFilePath_ () {
 *                  return IO::FileSystem::WellKnownLocations::GetApplicationData () + Options::kServiceConfigAppRelPathDir +  _T ("HFWServer.running");
 *              }
 *              support (so we can detect crash) and warn. Maybe include that  - maybe not. Maybe merge with pidfile - maybe not?
 *              Document reaosns for choices.
 *
 *              <OK - NO PIDFILE needed - but there is way in service control mgr - we should report back pid - in status display>
 *
 *      @todo   Fix Main::BasicUNIXServiceImpl::SignalHandler_() use of static variable. Race conditions
 *              accessing static var. Use instance var and proper locking.
 *
 *      @todo   Fix Main::BasicUNIXServiceImpl::SignalHandler_ on kSIG_ReReadConfiguration to somehow q message
 *              to re-read, and not invoke re-read from thread (avoid possible deadlock with allocating mem in signal handler).
 *
 *      @todo   Fix majorly hacked (and unsafe anyhow cuz of malloc in signal handler)
 *              stuff. Righjt now needed to make Sercice STOP work under posix, but its
 *              NOT reliably done!!!
 *
 *              SEE "ADD SAFE SIGNAL HANDLER (DEADLOCK FREE) SUPPORT" in Execution::Signal module
 *
 *      @todo   Carefully review Windows service code for thread locking and races. Complete missing cases, and
 *              bullet proof.
 *
 *      @todo   Support passing extra args to subprocess. For example, if we do --start --logfile=xxx,
 *              We need the invocation of EXE --Run-As-Service to ALSO take --logfile=xxx param. NYI
 *
 *      @todo   Add "Starting" and "Stopping" status values to possible states.
 *              Probably add extra states, and then callback parameter to IApplicationRep::MainLoop()
 *              so it can callback and say status moved from starting to running. Easier to automatically
 *              do the stopping/stopped change (cuz we have the hooks).
 *
 *              Added the startedCB method - just so fewer incompatible API-breaking changes needed in the
 *              future.
 *
 *      @todo   Implement/test (it maybe implemented) --ReloadConfiguration operation.
 *
 *      @todo - Main::CommandNames - consider making these STRING params, and then this could be end-user configurable (good idea!)
 *
 *      @todo   Main::CommandNames - provide for command aliases.
 *
 *      @todo   Document clearly the distinction between running service and driver
 *              to control stop/start etc. Think through relationship between windows
 *              approahc and unix approach
 *
 *      @todo   Windoze implementation - supporting the richer set of control mechanism.
 *              AT LEAST support --stop from command-line (currently broken - but you can use net stop or net start servicename;
 *
 *      @todo   Support Pause/Continue
 *
 * Long-Term TODO:
 *      @todo   Consider adding a 'heartbeat' mechanism - so callback in IApplicationRep
 *              called periodically to see if all OK, and otherwise have recovery strategies.

            /**
             *  A service is a program that runs in the background on your computer, and has no user interface.
             *
             *  This is often very handy - and often useful to mix together with a related non-service (UI)
             *  program component.
             *
             *  This concept exists on both UNIX and Windows, but is implemented differently.
             *
             *  There are two different dimentions along which you can subtype the behavior of a service application:
             *      (1) the functionality the service provides
             *      (2) the OS service mechanism to use
             *
             *  Users of this class will themselves address #1, by subclassing from the IApplicationRep, and providing their application
             *  behavior. But users can also select different 'service implementation' strategies by selecting the IServiceIntegrationRep subtype
             *  to pass into the constructor. What serice implementation strategies are available will depend on the OS you've built for,
             *  and often on command-line app arguments.
             *
             *  This class is sort of like a singleton, in that it can be instantiated only once, never copied, etc. But
             *  its unusual for the singleton pattern, since the user must explicitly construct it. The owner controls its lifetime.
             *
             *  Note that this class provides a convient wrapper on requesting actions on the underlying service
             *  from EITEHR the process in which the service is run, or from any other process (via IPC - specific to the process
             *  service backend implementation).
             *
             *  This class is 'final' - since the intended use is to provide polymorphic behavior via the REP classes passed
             *  in to the CTOR.
             *
             *  Miscelaneous Notes:
             *      o   No need for a --daemonize option for --Run-As-Service, because thats essentially
             *          what the --start command does
             *
             *  \par Example Usage
