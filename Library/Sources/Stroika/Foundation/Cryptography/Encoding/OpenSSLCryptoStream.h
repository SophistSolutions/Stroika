 *  TODO:
 *      @todo   Review https://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/EVP_EncryptInit.html and things like setkeylength etc to get
 *              rc4 working (idnetically with windows version)
 *
 *              See nt do_crypt(FILE *in, FILE *out, int do_encrypt) example.,
 *
 *              From examples, one bug maybe the value of inital_iv - EVP_CipherInit_ex - that the call may expect
 *              its the right lenght but the length is user-specified.. I may need to init to zero (or some such), and
 *              copy in user data.
 *
 *              I think for BOTH key and iv we must look at expected keylen/iplen and pass in data that matches the
 *              length. Maybe set what hack we did for CipherAlgorithm::eRC4?? set key length based on whats passed in?
 *
 *              We maybe can (mostly/always) set iv to NULL???
 *
 *              #if 0
 *                // DEBUG WHY THIS FAILS - I THINK WE NEED TO ENABLE PADDING FOR SOME CYPHERS!
 *               BLOB ((const Byte*)kSrc4_, (const Byte*)kSrc4_ + ::strlen(kSrc4_)),
 *          #endif
 *
 *      @todo   Generate exceptions on errors
 *
 *      @todo   this module includes <openssl> stuff in the header. Add additioanl modules inside
 *              Crypto that just are called 'Blowfish', and 'rc2', and these have classes that tkae
 *              constructors with just the needed data = maybe not even ctors - maybe functions - that
 *              take a stream, and return a decrpting (or encyrpting) stream - with arg params that make
 *              sense for that algoritjm. They are only defined #if qSSLAvail, but otherwise include
 *
 *              DONE for AES - BUt do the others - just like that - and maybe cleanup Base64/MD5 APIs to
 *              be done like for AES...
 *              ...
