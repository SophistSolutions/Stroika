This Folder contains the Foundation::Cryptography source code.

	This module mostly contains functions to convert a stream of data in 'unencoded' format to/from
	a stream of data in some 'encoded' format.

	NB: it is because of this organizational principle, that Base64 is grouped here
	(not in data format exchange).
