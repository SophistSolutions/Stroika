 *  @todo   https://stroika.atlassian.net/browse/STK-446 - AssertExternallySynchronizedLock
 *
 *  @todo   Consider if we want to make the promise currently defined below in Equals()
 *          about iterating two originally equal iterators. The trouble is - this doesn
 *          work with generators!!! -- REVIEW-- LGP 2013-12-30
 *
 *          THIS IS BAD AND MUST BE REWRITEN - NOT WAHT WE WANT - TOO STRONG A PROMISE.
 *
 *  @todo   Consider adding a Refresh() method to iterator. Semantics would be
 *          to recheck the current item, and recheck the done state of the container.
 *
 *          Use case is with map/reduce. Consider one process doing the mapping, and
 *          another reading the output (if we have &param version of map). Then the
 *          reader could check if done, and wait a moment, and check again (wait? how that?)
 *
 *          The key is that with map reduce you have parallel mapping and processing the output.
 *          But if iterating over output, hard (not impossible) to know you are at the end (length).
 *
 *          Restartable iterators would be one way.
 *
 *  @todo   See if we can replace Rep_Cloner_ stuff with lambda[] inline in type declaration? See if that
 *          has any negative impacts on performacnce/size etc (test win/gcc). Really more an issue
 *          for SharedByValue<> template.
 *
 *  @todo   CONSIDER using enabled_shared_from_this on ireps? Document why we chose to or not to
 *          (maybe test space). From preliminary testing (VC++2012) - it appears to just make things
 *          bigger, not smaller. Must test other compilers too, and maybe disassemble.
 *
 *  @todo   Speed tweeks
 *
 *          The Major Design limitaiton of this approach to iterators is that it requires a non-inlinable
 *          function call per iteration (roughly). Basically - if you pass a callback into an iterator rep
 *          then to APPLY that function on each iteration requires a non-inlinable (indirect through pointer)
 *          function call, or if you do the reverse, and directly use the iteraotr so no you can inline
 *          apply the function, you must call a virtual function for each iteration to bump the next pointer.
 *
 *          Fundementally - you have multiple polypmorphism (on representation of container and thing to apply
 *          at each iteration).
 *
 *          Two tricks:
 *              (1)     Paging.
 *                      Read a bunch at a time. This is tricky to implement and doesn't affect overall computational
 *                      complexity (because it reduces number of virtual calls by a constant factor). But if that
 *                      constant factor is big enough - 10-100-1000? - that still could be relevant pragmatically.
 *
 *                      The biggest challenge is preserving the existing stafety and patch semantics generically,
 *                      in light of update during iteration, and making sure for uses where that doesnt help its
 *                      not allowed to hurt.
 *
 *              (2)     special case common combinations. For example - at the point in the code where you have:
 *                      Iterator<T> i;
 *                      for (; i != e.end (); ++i) {
 *                          do_this();
 *                      }
 *
 *                      One could put in special purpose code for the Iterator<T>::operator++ that said:
 *                      if (dynamic_cast<Sequence_Array::_IRep*> (myIRep) != nullptr) {
 *                          then peek and cheat...
 *                      }
 *                      Maybe when the iterator is constructed - it checks for a couple important types
 *                      and sets a flag, so the only cost when this doesnt work is checking that bool flag.
 *                      And the benefit in teh more common case is you avoid the virtual function call! so the it++ can be
 *                      inlined (a big win oftne times).

            /**
             *  \brief
             *      An Iterator<T> is a copyable object which allows traversing the contents of some container.
             *
             *  An Iterator<T> is typically associated with some container (that is being iterated over)
             *  and which allows traversal from start to finish.
             *  (The iterator itself essentially provides a notion of *start* to *finish*).
             *
             *  There need not actually be a 'container' object. Other 'iterators' can be created, so long as
             *  they act like an iterator.
             *
             *  An Iterator<T> is a copyable object which can safely be used to capture (copy) the state of
             *  iteration and continue iterating from that spot. If the underlying container is
             *  modified, the iterator will be automatically updated to logically account for that update.
             *
             *  Iterators are robust in the presence of changes to their underlying container. Adding or
             *  removing items from a container will not invalidate the iteration.
             *
             *  Different kinds of containers can make further guarantees about the behavior of iterators
             *  in the presence of container modifications. For example a SequenceIterator will always
             *  traverse any items added after the current traversal index, and will never traverse items
             *  added with an index before the current traversal index.
             *
             *  \par Example Usage
             *      \code
             *          for (Iterator<T> i = container.MakeIterator (); not i.Done (); i.Next ())  {
             *              f (i.Current ());
             *          }
             *      \endcode
             *
             *  or:
             *      \code
             *          for (Iterator<T> i = container.begin (); i != container.end (); ++i)  {
             *              f (*i);
             *          }
             *      \endcode
             *
             *  or:
             *      \code
             *          for (T i : container)  {
             *              f (i);
             *          }
             *      \endcode
             *
             *  Key Differences between Stroika Iterators and STL Iterators:
             *
             *      1.      Stroika iterators are threadsafe. Updates to the underlying container
             *              never interfere with iteration, and need no explicit synchronization.
             *
             *      2.      Stroika iterators continue to work correctly when the underlying
             *              container is modified.
             *
             *      3.      Stroika iterators carry around their 'done' state all in one object.
             *              For compatability with existing C++ idiom, and some C++11 language features
             *              Stroika iterators inherit from std::iterator<> and allow use of end(),
             *              and i != end() to check for if an iterator is done. But internally,
             *              Stroika just checks i.Done(), and so can users of Stroika iterators.
             *
             *      4.      Stroika iterators are not 'random access'. They just go forwards, one step at a
             *              time. In STL, some kinds of iterators act more like pointers where you can do
             *              address arithmatic.
             *
             *      5.      In STL, reverse iterators are a special type, incompatible with regular iterator.s
             *              In Stroika, reverse iterators are also created with rbegin(), rend (), but
             *              their type is no differnt than regular iterators.
             *
             *
             * Some Rules about Iterators:
             *
             *      1.      What is Done() cannot be UnDone()
             *              That is, once an iterator is done, it cannot be restarted.
             *
             *      2.      Iterators can be copied. They always refer to the same
             *              place they did before the copy, and the old iterator is unaffected
             *              by iteration in the new (though it can be affected indirectly
             *              thru mutations).
             *
             *      3.      Whether or not you encounter items added after an addition is
             *              undefined (by Iterator<T> but often defined in specifically for
             *              particular container subtypes).
             *
             *      4.      A consequence of the above, is that items added after you are done,
             *              are not encountered.
             *
             *  Interesting Design Notes:
             *
             *      -   We considered a desgin for Current() - where it would dynamically
             *          grab the current value, as opposed to being defined to be frozen/copied
             *          at the time of iteration.
             *
             *          The advantage of the path not taken is that if you iterated several times without
             *          examining the current value, and if the cost of copying was relatively large, this
             *          definition would have worked out better.
             *
             *          However, because I think its far more frequent that the copies are cheap, the
             *          user will want to look at each value, and the cost in terms of thread locking
             *          and probabe virtual function calls, the current approach of freezing / copying
             *          on iteration seemed better.
             *
             *  @see Iterable<T>
             *
             *  \note   \em Thread-Safety
             *
             *          Iterator<T> instances are \em not thread-safe. That is - they cannot be read and
             *          or written from multiple threads at a time.
             *
             *          However, given how Iterators are meant to be, and are typically, used, this presents
             *          no problem.
             *
             *          They can be safely transfered across threads, and the underlying things being iterated over
             *          can be safely and transparently read/written from other threads
