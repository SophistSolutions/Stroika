## Overview

Unsure about top-level modularity - but makes sense to move iterator/iterable out of container - since can and should
be used for generators, like Range.

GENERATOR:

```
loop (yielder)
{
while (1) {
yielder(val);
}
}
```

    // the question is - is there any way todo this without threads? I could run a look on a thread and yield would 'send a message' back to the
    // iterator? That maybe how it needs to happen.
    	class generator : iterable<T> {
    		public:

    			generator (std:function<void(std::function<void(T)> yielder)>);
    	};

    	Plus - we need a better way to handle GetLength () - like 'not supported' - or maybe lose it as a common method of iterable?
    	we could just iterate (make new useless iterator). That maybe OK. But not for things that genrate  infinite sequne.
