 *
 * TODO:
 *
 *      @todo   Support various 64bit int (epoch time) types - even if time_t is 32-bit (such as on AIX).
 *              Be careful about overflow in underlying types like Date and TimeOfDay() however.
 *
 *      @todo   I'm not sure eCurrentLocale_WithZerosStripped is a good idea. Not sure if better
 *              to use separate format print arg or???
 *
 *      @todo   LCID stuff appears to be obsolete, and perhaps not supported by MSFT any longer. Consider
 *              de-supporting.
 *
 *      @todo   Current logic for TIMEZONE conversion is questionable. When we output to XML,
 *              we output the timezone offset of the currnet timezone and the daylight savingstime
 *              value as of that date. But when we read date - we ignore the offset (assume its localetime).
 *
 *      @todo   We sometimes store datetime internally as localetime, and sometimes as UTC. Maybe we
 *              should alway use UTC? If we use localtime and the timezone changes while we are running
 *              (timezone or DST) - we could get funky results.
 *
 *      @todo   (medium) Consider using strftime and strptime with %FT%T%z.
 *              Same format
 *              That doesn’t use std::locale()
 *              En.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/manip/get_time
 *              istringstream xxx (“2011-feb…”)
 *              ss.imbue(std::locale() (“de-DE”));
 *              ss >> std::get_time(&t, “%FT%T%z”)
 *
 *      @todo   Maybe use wcsftime (buf, NEltsOf (buf), L"%I:%M %p", &temp);   or related for formatting dates/time?
 *
 *      @todo   Consider using strptime/strftime - and possibly use that to replace windows formatting APIs?
 *
 *      @todo   Should we PIN or throw OVERFLOW exception on values/requests which are out of range?
 *
 *      @todo   Consider replacing eXML with eISO8601_PF?  Not 100% sure they are the same. Maybe we should
 *              support BOTH here? Maybe where they differ doesn't matter for this class?
 *
 *      @todo   Error checking in conversions (date to string/Format/String2Date - should be doign THROWS on
 *              bad conversions I think - moistly an issue for the locale-based stuff. Now it maybe just
 *              silently returns empty date/time/etc. Better to except!
 *
 *      @todo   Future directions consider representing as big struct
 *          o   And maybe store cached string reps for common cases as optimization and
 *              store cached second-offset (mutable) for quick compares
 *          o   Note for timeofday it COULD be enhanced in the future to store TOD as
 *              fractional number of seconds. COULD use LINUX style struct with number of seconds and fixed
 *              point like number of nanoseconds (or some such)
 *
 *      @todo   (minor) Consider if DateTime stuff should cache locale () in some methods (static) –
 *              so can be re-used?? Performance tweek cuz current stuff doing new locale() does
 *              locking to bump refcount?

             *  Description:
             *
             *      DateTime is more than just a combination of Date, and Time. It also introduces the notion of TIMEZONE.
             *
             *      There are 3 possabilities for timezone - LOCALTIME, GMT, and UNKNOWN.
             *
             *      'empty' concept:
             *          Treat it as DISTINCT from any other DateTime. However, when converting it to a number
             *          of seconds or days (JulienRep), treat empty as DateTime::kMin. For format routine,
             *          return empty string. And for COMPARIONS (=,<,<=, etc) treat it as LESS THAN DateTime::kMin.
             *          This is a bit like the floating point concept of negative infinity.
             *
             *          This concept is the same as the Date::empty () concept.
             *
             *  <<<CONSIDERING MAYBE REQUIRING>>>
             *          Also note that if empty () - BOTH the date and timeofday parts of the DateTime must be empty, and
             *          the value of timezone is undefined.
             *  <<</CONSIDERING MAYBE REQUIRING>>>
             *
             *  \note   This type properties (kMin/kMax) can only be used after static initialization, and before
             *          static de-initializaiton.
             *
             *  \note   See coding conventions document about operator usage: Compare () and operator<, operator>, etc
