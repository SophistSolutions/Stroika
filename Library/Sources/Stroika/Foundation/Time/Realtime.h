             *
             *  Note - though this is based on the same reference time as an time values packed into event records,
             *  it maybe differently normalized. These times are all in seconds, whereas event records are often in
             *  other units (ticks - 1/60 of a second, or milliseconds).
             *
             *  In the case of X-Windows - this business is very complicated because there are two different times
             *  one might be intersted in. There is the time on the client (where Led is running) and the time on the X-Server
             *  (users computer screen). Alas - X11R4 appears to have quite weak support for time - and offers no way I've found
             *  to accurately get the time from the users computer. As a result - with X-Windows - you must arrange to call
             *  @'SyncronizeLedXTickCount' for each event that specifies a time value (as soon as that event arrives). This
             *  data - together with time values from the client (where Led is running) computer will be used to provide a
             *  better approximation of the true elapsed time.
