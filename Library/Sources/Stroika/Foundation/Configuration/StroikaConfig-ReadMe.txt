Stroika Foundation configuration is driven off the #define values included in
StroikaConfig.h.

StroikaConfig.h is usually auto-generated by the configure process, but you can
build/provider your own. There are a large number of defines which must be
defined by StroikaConfig.h, but there are default values inferred for all of them (if
you include the right files in StroikaConfig.h).

You can run configure to generate a defualt file and then edit yours to add
custom values (before the defaults - they won't get overridden).

Note that since StroikaConfig.h CAN define #defines which are required before including system includes, its required
that it be included before all others (like a precomp.h precompiled header file).

This is the ONLY file this is true of. Otherwise, we generally include system files before other Stroika files etc.
