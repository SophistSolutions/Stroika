    /**
     *  \brief  Thread is a namespace for Stroika thread code, @see Thread::Ptr or @Thread::New
     *
     *      Stroika Threads are built on std::thread, so can be used mostly interoperably. However,
     *  Stroika threads add a number of very useful features to std::threads:
     *          o   Cancelation/Interruption/Aborting
     *          o   EINTR handling (POSIX only)
     *
     *  as well as a couple modestly helpful features (that can be done other ways directly with std::thread):
     *          o   Copyability (using Thread::Ptr)
     *          o   Better lifetime management (the thread envelope - object you create - can go away, but
     *              the underlying thread can continue running, with its memory/resources being cleaned
     *              up autoamtically.
     *          o   And several smaller features like (mostly) portably setting thread priorities, names, etc and more
     *
     *  Note - the cancelation feature is very handy for building large scale applications which use
     *  worker tasks and things like thread pools, to be able to reclaim resources, cancel ongoing operations
     *  as useless, and maintain overall running system integrity.
     *
     *  Using the smartpointer wrapper Thread around a thread guarantees its reference counting
     *  will work safely - so that even when all external references go away, the fact that the thread
     *  is still running will keep the reference count non-zero.
     *
     *  Thread Aborting/Interruption:
     *      The Stroika Thread class supports the idea of 'interrupting' or 'aborting' a thread.
     *
     *  \em Nomenclature Note:
     *       In some libraries, the term interruption, cancelation is used for thread aborting.
     *              >   java uses interruption
     *              >   boost uses cancelation,
     *              >   POSIX uses cancelation (pthread_canel)
     *              >   and .net uses Interrupt and Abort
     *
     *  The basic idea is that a thread goes off on its own, doing stuff, and an external force
     *  decides to tell it to stop.
     *
     *  Examples of this might be:
     *      (1) A search user interface, which starts searching as the user types. Once the process
     *          has received a certain number of characters it starts searching, but perhaps before
     *          the search is done, another character comes in, so the GUI code will want to Abort
     *          the existing search, and start a new one (with the extra character(s)).
     *      (2) A web server - which is serving up content, and it told to shut-down. It must interrupt
     *          existing in process processes - some maybe handling a read/write sequence, and some
     *          perhaps doing a socket listen/accept call.
     *
     *  When a thread is interrupted, it (in that thread) throws
     *      class   InterruptException;
     *
     *  When a thread is aborted, it (in that thread) throws
     *      class   AbortException;
     *
     *  The only difference between Interruption and Aborting is that Aborting is permanent, whereas
     *  Interrupt happens just once.
     *
     *  Thread 'interruption' happens via 'cancelation points'. Cancelation points are points in the code
     *  where we check to see if the current running thread has been interupted (or aborted) and raise
     *  the appropriate exception. 
     *
     *  This mechanism is almost completely co-operative, meaning that user
     *  code must call CheckForThreadInterruption () in the right places to make interruption work. But Stroika
     *  is structured to make that happen automatically throughout most of its code, but having key routines (like Sleep, and WaitableEvents)
     *  automatically internally be cancelation points.
     *
     *  The only slight exception to this is on Windows, where we have the APC mechanism that will interupt a wide vareity of windows
     *  system calls (see docs below).
     *
     *  \note - its important that this 'interruption' can only happen at well defined times, because that allows
     *        for safe and reliable cleanup of whatever activitites were being done (e.g. cannot interupt in a destructor)
     *
     *  Thread interruption/aborting is tricky todo safely and portably. We take a safe, cooperative approach.
     *      (1) We maintain a thread-local-storage variable - saying if this thread has been aborted.
     *          Sprinkling CheckForThreadInterruption throughout your code - will trigger an InterupptedException () or AbortException ()
     *          in that thread context. Note a pointer to that TLS interruption variable is also stored
     *          in the thread 'rep' object, so it can be set (by Thread::Interrupt).
     *
     *      (2) WINDOWS ONLY: Async-injection (QueueUserAPC/Windows) - Alertable state -  certain (alertable) functions get interrupted and return 
     *          WAIT_IO_COMPLETION (like POSIX EINTR).
     *
     *          @see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363772(v=vs.85).aspx
     *              o   SleepEx
     *              o   WaitForSingleObjectEx
     *              o   WaitForMultipleObjectsEx
     *              o   SignalObjectAndWait
     *              o   MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx
     *          But also from https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms741669(v=vs.85).aspx
     *              o   WSAPoll ... Winsock performs an alertable, similarly for recvfrom, accept, etc. Not clear how to get full list of
     *                  windows alertable functions...
     *
     *          This allows interrupting windows waiting / blocking functions (most of them).
     *
     *      (3) POSIX ONLY: Signal injection - we send a special (defaults to SIG_USR2) signal to a particular thread.
     *          This triggers an EINTR on most UNIX system calls, which are automatically restarted in most cases
     *          (@see Execution::Handle_ErrNoResultInterruption), but in case of interruption, we call
     *          CheckForThreadInterruption ()
     *
     *          This allows interrupting UNIX waiting / blocking functions (all of them?).
     *
     *  \note @see defails on cancelation points, because many common std C++ blocking operations, like std::mutex are not
     *        std::condition_variable are not cancelation points and so can break this mechanism if not used carefully
     *
     * Handle_ErrNoResultInterruption()
     *      The short of it is that you need to catch EINTR and restart the call for these system calls:
     *          o read, readv, write, writev, ioctl
     *          o open() when dealing with a fifo
     *          o wait*
     *          o Anything socket based (send*, recv*, connect, accept etc)
     *          o flock and lock control with fcntl
     *          o mq_ functions which can block
     *          o futex
     *          o sem_wait (and timed wait)
     *          o pause, sigsuspend, sigtimedwait, sigwaitinfo
     *          o poll, epoll_wait, select and 'p' versions of the same
     *          o msgrcv, msgsnd, semop, semtimedop
     *          o close (although, on Linux, EINTR won't happen here)
     *          o any sleep functions (careful, you need to handle this are restart with
     *              different arguments)
     *      This is integrated with Stroika's thread cancelation mechanism.
     *
     *  @see Handle_ErrNoResultInterruption
     *
     *  ***Thread Cancelation Points***
     *      A cancelation point is any (typically but not always blocking) funciton which will be interupted (cause interruption exception) and stop blocking,
     *      when someone calls Thread::Interupt or Thread::Abort() on its thread object.
     *
     *      Roughly, these are subroutines which call 
     *          CheckForThreadInterruption ()
     *      frequently, internally.
     *
     *      As its crucial to understand this in the API, we document each such function with ***Cancelation Point*** in its doc header.
     *      For example, the Sleep() overloads are cancelation points.
     *
     *      Equally important to understand, is when a function guarantees its NOT a cancelation point - which we will document
     *      with ***Not Cancelation Point***, and typically also noexcept. The DbgTrace () calls fall into this category.
     *
     *      \note An API marked *** Cancelation Point *** will always CheckForThreadInterruption () at least once (or equivilent check)
     *            and will never block indefinitely without periodically checking for interruption.
     *
     *  \note   Stroika threads lifetime must NOT extend outside the lifetime of 'main'. That means they cannot
     *          be started by static constructors, and must not be left running past the end of main, to
     *          be shut down by static destructors. The reason for this is that its too hard to guarantee
     *          all the rest of the Stroika infrastructure (signals etc) work properly in that context,
     *          and its do overwhemlingly likely a softare bug waiting to happen.
     *
     *          If you must have a thread running like that, use std::thread (though I'm not sure how well that
     *          will work either).
     *
     *          Note the Thread 'smartpointer' wrapper can be constructed/destructed statically (before/after main). You
     *          just cannot start a thread before main, nor allow it to still be running (not completed) before exiting.
     *          #if qStroika_Foundation_Exection_Thread_SupportThreadStatistics (defaults true in debug builds) an attempt
     *          is made to auto-detect this and diagnose it in the tracelog and with assertions.
     *
     *  \note   Considered adding an API to return the underlying std::thread or std::thread::native_handle (), but
     *          have not needed this so far, and it might create some confusion about ownership? Detaching would be
     *          a problem because the owned thread object has hooks into the Stroika Thread object, so that kind of
     *          needs to be left around. I suppose we might want to allow an accessor to std::thread* which is like an
     *          internal pointer (thread safety questions too with that). MAYBE better to just allow construction of a 
     *          Stroika Thread from an std::thread (but then we don't have the wrapper logic for maining reference counts).
     *          No compelling need so far, and no obviously best approach.
