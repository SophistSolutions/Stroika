            /**
             *  A simple wrapper on a std::condition_variable, with support for Stroika thread Cancelation, and 
             *  other shortcuts to simplify use. (combines related mutex with condition variable)
             *
             *  Intentionally leave 'mutex' and 'condition_variable' elements public, because users will OFTEN
             *  need to directly access a reference to the mutex, and so there is little opportunity to hide.
             *
             *  This is just meant to codify some good practices and share some code. Its a VERY thin wrapper - if even
             *  that - on the std::mutex.
             *
             *  \par Example Usage
             *      \code
             *          ConditionVariable<> fConditionVariable;
             *          bool                fTriggered = false;
             *
             *          // THREAD A:
             *           fConditionVariable.MutateDataNotifyAll ([=]() { fTriggered = true; });
             *
             *          // THREAD B:
             *          std::unique_lock<mutex> lock (fConditionVariable.fMutex);
             *          if (fConditionVariable.wait_until (lock, timeoutAt, [this]() { return fTriggered; })) {
             *              REACT TO CHANGE ();
             *          }
             *          else {
             *              Throw (TimeOutException ());
             *          }
             *      \endcode

             *  \note   Design Note on implementing thread cancelation
             *          >   There are three obvious ways to implement cancelation
             *
             *              >   Uinsg EINTR (POSIX) and alertable states on windows - this is what we do most other places
             *                  in Stroika for thread cancelability.
             *
             *                  Sadly, the POSIX (gcc/clang) of condition_variable dont appear to support EINTR, the windows
             *                  implementation doesn't support alertable states, and (FIND REFERENCE***) I THINK I saw documented
             *                  someplace the standard metnions that this cannot be done (no idea why)
             *
             *              >   Maintain a list of 'waiting' condition variables, and then have thread-abort notify_all() on each of these
             *                  This significantly adds to the cost of waiting (add/remove safely from linked list with thread safety) - but
             *                  thats probably still the best approach.
             *
             *                  Also have to code this very carefully to avoid deadlocks, since the cancelation code needs to lock something to
             *                  allow it to safely signal the condition variable.
             *
             *                  ***Probably best approach but trickier todo***
             *
             *              >   Just wake periodically (shorten the wait time) and look for aborts). This is arguably the most costly approach
             *                  but also simplest to implement, and what we have for now (as of January 2018, version v2.0a225)
             *
             *  \note   From http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/condition_variable
             *              "Even if the shared variable is atomic, it must be modified under the mutex in order
             *              to correctly publish the modification to the waiting thread."
             *
             *          I believe this is because:
             *              The total ordering created by this pattern of update is crucial!
             *
             *              Thread A lock and then unlocks mutex, so change of state of triggered always BEFORE (or after)
             *              the change of state in the condition variable mutex, so no ambiguity about when fTriggered set.
             *
             *              If its set before, condition variable sees that on entry (in its pred check).
             *
             *              If its after, then on the mutex unlock (I DONT KNOW HOW THIS HAPPENS YET) - the Condition
             *              var must somehow get 'awkakened' - probably by a TLS list (queue) of waiters to get notififed
             *              and that gets hooked in the mutex code???? GUESSING.
             *
             *              So anyhow - note - its critical when changing values of underlying 'condition' - to wrap that in mutex
             *              lock/unlock.
             *
             *              This MAYBE related to why "std::condition_variable works only with std::unique_lock<std::mutex>".
             *              BUT - then i dont understand how " std::condition_variable_any provides a condition variable that works with any BasicLockable"
