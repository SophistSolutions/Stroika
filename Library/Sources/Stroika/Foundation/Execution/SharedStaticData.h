             *  SharedStaticData<T> is used to safely create a copy of static data shared among various users
             *  in a thread safe way, and where the shared data goes away when the last reference does.
             *
             *  This is very similar to have a single static variable of type T, except that instead of
             *  having T constructed at global execution time, and destroyed at global object destruction time,
             *  it happens when the first owner comes into existence and when the last owner goes out of existance.
             *
             *  For example - if the shared data object creates threads, it can be a problem having this destroyed in
             *  a static (file scope) lifetime.
             *
             *  This is also similar to the @see ModuleInit<> template, except that this is intended to give the
             *  user tighter control over lifetime of the shared data.
             *
             *  \par Example Usage
             *      \code
             *              class   AuditLogSink {
             *                  ...
             *                  private:
             *                      struct SharedData_;
             *                      Execution::SharedStaticData<SharedData_>    fSharedData_;
             *              };
             *              struct  AuditLogSink::SharedData_ {
             *                  Execution::Thread::Ptr                   fCleanupThread;
             *
             *                  SharedData_ ()
             *                      : fCleanupThread (Thread::New (&AuditLogSink::SimpleCleanupThread_))
             *                  {
             *                      fCleanupThread.SetThreadPriority (Thread::Priority::eLowest);
             *                      fCleanupThread.SetThreadName (L"AuditTrailCleanupThread");
             *                      fCleanupThread.Start ();
             *                  }
             *                  ~SharedData_ ()
             *                  {
             *                      fCleanupThread.AbortAndWaitForDone ();
             *                  }
             *              };
             *      \endcode
             *
             *  So then on the first AuditLogSink construction - we construct the cleanup thread, and on the last the
             *  thread is shutdown. If these objects are all created after main, this assures the thread startup/cleanup
             *  is all done after the start of main and before it completes.
             *
             *  \note   Since this object is in its 'default initialized' state with all zeros, it is safe to use before
             *          the start of main (), and doesn't require the complicated inter-depependency managment of the
             *          @ModuleInit code.

            https://stackoverflow.com/questions/185624/static-variables-in-an-inlined-function

            [..] An inline function with external linkage shall have the same address in all translation units. A static local variable in an extern inline function always refers to the same object. A string literal in an extern inline function is the same object in different translation units.
