             *  SharedStaticData<T> is used to safely create a copy of static data shared among various users
             *  in a thread safe way, and where the shared data goes away when the last reference does.
             *
             *  This is very similar to have a single static variable of type T, except that instead of
             *  having T constructed at global execution time, and destroyed at global object destruction time,
             *  it happens when the first owner comes into existence and when teh last owner goes out of existance.
             *
             *  For example - if the shared data object creates threads, it can be a problem having this destroyed in
             *  a static (file scope) lifetime.
             *
             *  This is also similar to the @see ModuleInit<> template, except that this is intended to give the
             *  user tighter control over lifetime of the shared data.
             *
             *  Example usage (from HealthFrameWorksServer):
             *
             *              class   AuditLogSink {
             *                  ...
             *                  private:
             *                      struct SharedData_;
             *                      Execution::SharedStaticData<SharedData_>    fSharedData_;
             *              };
             *              struct  AuditLogSink::SharedData_ {
             *                  Execution::Thread                   fCleanupThread;
             *
             *                  SharedData_ ()
             *                      : fCleanupThread (Thread (&AuditLogSink::SimpleCleanupThread_))
             *                  {
             *                      fCleanupThread.SetThreadPriority (Thread::Priority::eLowest);
             *                      fCleanupThread.SetThreadName (L"AuditTrailCleanupThread");
             *                      fCleanupThread.Start ();
             *                  }
             *                  ~SharedData_ ()
             *                  {
             *                      fCleanupThread.AbortAndWaitForDone ();
             *                  }
             *              };
             *
             *  So then on the first AuditLogSink construction - we construct the cleanup thread, and on the last the
             *  thread is shutdown. If these objects are all created after main, this assures the thread startup/cleanup
             *  is all done after the start of main and before it completes.
