             *  This helpful utility to plug a missing feature from C++11 - to have a block of code run at the end
             *  of a scope - regardless of whether you use normal exit or exception based exit.
             *
             *  This has some defects:
             *      o   The cleanup code must be wrapped in a lambda
             *
             *      o   The syntax is ugly - the cleanup having to be declared
             *          BEFORE the block instead of afterwards (languages like C# with try/finally the finally goes
             *          at the end)
             *
             *      o   Exceptions inside of cleanupCodeBlock are suppressed
             *
             *  Inspired by:
             *      http://nerds-central.blogspot.com/2012/03/c11-trycatchfinally-pattern-using-raii.html
