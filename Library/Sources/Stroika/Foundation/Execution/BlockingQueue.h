/*
 *  \version    <a href="code_status.html#Beta">Beta</a>
 *
 * TODO:
 *      @todo   Add method to "CopyQueue" which takes a SNAPSHOT of the current Queue and returns it.
 *
 *      @todo   Add clear example of usage...
 *
 *      @todo   Use condition variables (instead of waitable event?) Or explain why not. Waitable event
 *              uses them, so maybe thats enouf
 *
 *      @todo   Perhaps have PeekHead() take timeout=0 optional param?
 *
 *      @todo   Perhaps rename to Message Queue or EventQueue
 *
 *              Event Q bad name, cuz misleading (not just for events and could be confused with
 *              waitable events).
 *
 *              Just DOOCUMENT that these are common synonyms.
 *
 *      @todo   Consider if/how to integrate with Foundation::Containers::Queue
 *
 *              I'm pretty sure the right answer is to SUBCLASS from Queue, but for AddTail/RemoveHead - and
 *              overloads with the timeout logic.
 *
 *              maybe just templated or otther param? What about priority Queue?
 *
 *      @todo   Add docs on why no WaitForMultipleObjects, and instead use
 *              http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/BlockingQueue.html
 *              (which is already in README file for Foundation::Execution::ReadMe.md
 *
 *      @todo   This - I THINK - essentially replaces the need for WaitForMultipleObjects.
 *              Maybe add utility class that runs threads that wait on each individual object,
 *              and then POST an event to this Q when available. Then the caller can wait on events
 *              for that Q.
 *                  Maybe at least have a utility class that takes a socket set (fd_set) and
 *              posts (but what?) to the Q (maybe utility class templated and takes value to
 *              be posted?) - so does a posix select/poll (careful to be cancelable) - and
 *              posts to event Q as needed.
 *
 *      @todo   Consider linking this to ThreadPools - so that instead of having a single
 *              thread running the Q, you have an entire threadpool. Maybe thats an attachable
 *              attribute of the Q?
