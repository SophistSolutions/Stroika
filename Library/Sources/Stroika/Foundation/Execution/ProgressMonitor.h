/**
 * TODO:

 *
 *      @todo   MAYBE allow copy - but just document its a smart pointer and copy just increments refcount.
 *              NOT copy by value semantics.
 *
 *      @todo   If we make (document) VariantValue to be theradsafe, then we can lift critical section
 *              use here and make it simpler!
 *
 *      @todo   Look at stuff I did I HeatthFrame progress code to automatically increase displayed progress values
 *              to monotonically when i have guesses - like for network activities. That should somehow integrate
 *              with this - maybe as an optional 'updater' module/adapter?
 *
 *      @todo   Not sure if we need to decompose into more component classes and use subtyping for stuff like
 *              thread support. It seems it mgiht work like this, but I'm sure it's not yet elegant.

            /**
             *  ProgressMonitor is the basic interface used for progress tracking. Progress tracking both
             *  measures progress, and supports the notion of canceling. The reason progres and cancelability
             *  are tied together is that its only for 'long lived' tasks one might want to measure the progress of,
             *  that one might want to allow canceling.
             *
             *  A progress Monitor owns a list of ChangedCallbackType that can be associated with the ProgressMonitor.
             *  These callbacks are each called whenever the progress is known to have changed. Note - this callback
             *  uses std::function<>, and the callback runs on an arbitrary thread, not necessarily the one used
             *  by the creator of the ProgressMonitor.
             *
             *  A ProgressMonitor also has associated with it an arbitrary number of Updater objects. These are the things
             *  that one hands to processes (not OS processes, but long lived procedures or threads) whcih they then
             *  callback to to notify of thier progress.
             *
             *  An updater is retrieved from the root ProgressMonitor, and it has 'scope' of 0..1. You can construct
             *  sub-updaters by passing a base Updater to the Updater constructor along with a subrange (inside 0..1).
             *  That way - if you have sub-procedures, they can report on thier progress (0..1) and that is mapped to a subrange
             *  of the overall progress.
             *
             *  Note - in order to help debug the progress values, ProgressMonitor strictly enforces some rules. Progress
             *  starts at zero, and successive values are non-degreasing. This means the progress bar grows monotonically (though
             *  not necessarily smoothly). In order to avoid common floating point bugs with roudning errors, ProgressMonitor
             *  employs Math::PinToSpecialPoint ().
             *
             *  Users of ProgressMonitor can call "Cancel" on the ProgressMonitor at any point. This records a cancelation
             *  in the Updater object, so that when it calls Updater::SetCurrentProgressAndThrowIfCanceled () - and
             *  perhaps in other situations (see thread support below) - the progress will terminate immediately.
             *
             *  ProgressMontitor supports having the underlying long-lived-task happen EITHER in the current thread, or in
             *  another thread (the ProgressMonitor and related code is fully threadsafe).
             *
             *  If ProgressMontitor is constructed with an argument Thread (optional) - then attempts to Cancel the ProgressMonitor
             *  will also send an Abort() command to the associated thread. This can accelerate - depending less on co-operative
             *  checking - to cancel the long-lived progress-monitored process.
