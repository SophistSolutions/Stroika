 *  TODO:
 *
 *      @todo   Just got rid of some fCriticalSection_ use - review - maybe can get rid of ALL of it!
 *
 *      @todo   REDO USING Stroika Q - CONSIDER USE OF blcoking q - I htink it will help. Or firgure out
 *              how these tie together. Issue with using Queue<> is that we nee dto be able to remove
 *              something from the middle of it, which isnt reasonable for a queue. Or is it?
 *
 *              Not sure if fix is to use Stroika sequnece here, or to change Queue to allow Remove(iterator);
 *
 *      @todo   Current approach to aborting a running task is to abort the thread. But the current
 *              thread code doesn't support restarting a thread once its been aborted. We PROBABLY
 *              should correct that at some point - and allow a thread to undo its abort-in-progress.
 *              However - no need immediately. Instead - the current ThreadPool implemenation simply
 *              drops that thread and builds a new one. Performacne overhead yes - but only for the
 *              likely rare case of aborting a running task.
 *
 *      @todo   Consider adding the idea of TaskGroups - which are properties shared by all tasks (or some tasks)
 *              added to a threadpool. If multiple tasks are added to the threadpool with the same
 *              TaskGroup, then they respect that taskgroup's contraints. One example constraint would be
 *              mutual run exclusion. This would allow you to create lockless threaded procedures, because
 *              they would be gauranteed to not be run all at the same time, and yet could STILL leverage
 *              the benefits of thread pooling.
 *
 *              For example, if you had 3 threads in the pool, and 5 thread groups, then typically one or
 *              more thread groups would be idle. The thread groups give you lockless execution, and
 *              the threadpool lets the 5 groups run 'at the same time' on only 3 threads.

             *  The ThreadPool class creates a small fixed number of Thread objects, and lets you use them
             *  as if there were many more. You submit a task (representable as a copyable IRunnable) -
             *  and it gets eventually executed.
             *
             *  If as Task in the thread pool raises an exception - this will be IGNORED (except for the
             *  special case of Thread::AbortException which  is used internally to end the threadpool or
             *  remove some threads). Because of this, your submitted runnables should take care of their own
             *  error handling internally.
             *
             *  ThreadPool mainly useful for servicing lost-cost calls/threads, where the overhead
             *  of constructing the thread is significant compared to the cost of performing the action,
             *  and where the priority & stacksize can all be predeterimed and 'shared'.
             *  Also - where you want to CONTROL the level of thread creation (possibly to avoid
             *  DOS attacks or just accidental overloading).

                 *      to first create a variable, and then do the add task, you can just do them together. And it avoids mistakes like:
                 *          function<void()> f = ...;
                 *          p.AddTask(f);
