 *
 *      @todo   https://stroika.atlassian.net/browse/STK-657 - experiment with some sort of shared_recursive_mutex - not sure good idea in general, but maybe a limited form can be used in syncrhonized
 *
 *      @todo   More operator<, and other operator overloads
 *
 *      @todo   Tons of cleanups, orthoganiality, docs, etc.
 *
 *      @todo   consider/doc choice on explicit operator T ()
 *
 *      @todo   Consider an UpgradeLock API like:
 *              nonvirtual optional<WritableReference> Experimental_UpgradeLock (ReadableReference* readReference)
 *              {
 *                  AssertNotImplemented ();

 *              }
 *              // But tricky because as of C++17, shared_mutex and shared_timed_mutex dont allow you to BOTH have a shared_lock and lock()
 *              // at the same time, with the same mutex.
 *              //
 *              // boost upgrade-lock?

         *  \brief  Wrap any object with Synchronized<> and it can be used similarly to the base type,
         *          but safely in a thread safe manner, from multiple threads. This is similar to std::atomic.
         *
         *  The idea behind any of these synchronized classes is that they can be used freely from
         *  different threads without worry of data corruption. It is almost as if each operation were
         *  preceeded with a mutex lock (on that object) and followed by an unlock.
         *
         *  If one thread does a Read operation on Synchronized<T> while another does a write (modification)
         *  operation on Synchronized<T>, the Read will always return a consistent reasonable value, from
         *  before the modification or afterwards, but never a distorted invalid value.
         *
         *  This is very much closely logically the java 'synchronized' attribute, except that its
         *  not a language extension/attribute here, but rather a class wrapper. Its also implemented
         *  in the library, not the programming language.
         *
         *  \note   LIKE JAVA SYNCHRONIZED
         *          This is SIMPLE to use like the Java (and .net) synchronized attribute(lock) mechanism.
         *          But why does it not suffer from the same performance deficiit?
         *
         *          Because with Java - you mixup exceptions and assertions. With Stroika, we have builtin
         *          checking for races (Debug::AssertExternallySynchronizedLock) in most objects, so
         *          you only use Synchronized<> (or some other more performant mechanism) in the few places
         *          you need it.
         *
         *  \note   Synchronized<> is similar to std::atomic, except that
         *          *   You can use it as a mutex with lock_guard and lock for an extended period of time.
         *          *   This supports read/write locks.
         *          *   This supports locking objects and updated bits of them - not just replacing all at one go
         *
         *  \par Example Usage
         *      \code
         *          Synchronized<String> n;                                                 // SAME
         *          Synchronized<String,Synchronized_Traits<>> n;                           // SAME
         *          Synchronized<String,Synchronized_Traits<recursive_mutex>>       n;      // SAME
         *      \endcode
         *
         *  or slightly faster, but possibly slower or less safe (depnding on usage)
         *      \code
         *          Synchronized<String,Synchronized_Traits<SpinLock>>              n;
         *      \endcode
         *
         *  or to allow timed locks
         *      \code
         *          Synchronized<String,Synchronized_Traits<timed_recursive_mutex>> n;
         *      \endcode
         *
         *  or to read-modify-update in place
         *      \code
         *          //nb: lock lasts til end of enclosing scope
         *          auto    lockedConfigData = fConfig_.rwget ();
         *          lockedConfigData->SomeValueChanged = 1;
         *      \endcode
         * 
         *  or to read-modify-update with explicit temporary
         *      \code
         *          //nb: lock lasts til end of enclosing scope
         *          auto    lockedConfigData = fConfig_.rwget ();
         *          T       value = lockedConfigData;
         *          value.SomeValueChanged = 1;
         *          lockedConfigData.store (value);
         *      \endcode
         *
         *  or, because Synchronized<> has lock/unlock methods, it can be used with a lock_guard (if associated mutex recursive), as in:
         *      \code
         *          auto&& critSec = lock_guard{n};
         *          // lock to make sure someone else doesn't change n after we made sure it looked good
         *          if (looks_good (n)) {
         *              String a = n;
         *              a = a + a;
         *              n.store (a);
         *          }
         *      \endcode
         *
         *  \note   We consider supporting operator-> for Synchronized<> - and overloading on const to see if we use a Read Lock or a Write lock.
         *          The problem is - that IF its called through a non-const object, it will select the non-const (write lock) even though all that
         *          was needed was the read lock! So this paradigm - though more terse and clear - just encourages inefficient coding (so we
         *          have no read locks - all locks write locks).
         *
         *          So ONLY support operator-> const overload (brevity and more common than for write). To write - use rwget().
