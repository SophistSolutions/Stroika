             *          but safely in a thread safe manner, from multiple threads. This is similar to std::atomic.
             *
             *  The idea behind any of these synchronized classes is that they can be used freely from
             *  different threads without worry of data corruption. It is almost as if each operation were
             *  preceeded with a mutex lock (on that object) and followed by an unlock.
             *
             *  If one thread does a Read operation on Synchronized<T> while another does a write (modification)
             *  operation on Synchronized<T>, the Read will always return a consistent reasonable value, from
             *  before the modification or afterwards, but never a distorted invalid value.
             *
             *  This is very much closely logically the java 'synchronized' attribute, except that its
             *  not a language extension/attribute here, but rather a class wrapper. Its also implemented
             *  in the library, not the programming language.
             *
             *  \note   LIKE JAVA SYNCHRONIZED
             *          This is SIMPLE to use like the Java (and .net) synchronized attribute(lock) mechanism.
             *          But why does it not suffer from the same performance deficiit?
             *
             *          Because with Java - you mixup exceptions and assertions. With Stroika, we have builtin
             *          checking for races (Debug::AssertExternallySynchronizedLock) in most objects, so
             *          you only use Synchronized<> (or some other more performant mechanism) in the few places
             *          you need it.
             *
             *  \note   Synchonized<> is similar to std::atomic, except that
             *          *   You can use it as a mutex with lock_guard and lock for an extended period of time.
             *          *   This supports read/write locks.
             *          *   This supports locking objects and updated bits of them - not just replacing all at one go
             *
             *  \par Example Usage
             *      \code
             *          Synchronized<String> n;                                                 // SAME

             *      \code
             *          Synchronized<String,Synchronized_Traits<SpinLock>>              n;
             *      \endcode
             *
             *  or to allow timed locks

             *      \endcode
             *
             *  or to read-modify-update in place
             *      \code
             *          //nb: lock lasts til end of enclosing scope
             *          auto    lockedConfigData = fConfig_.rwget ();
             *          lockedConfigData->SomeValueChanged = 1;
             *      \endcode
             *
             *  or to read-modify-update with explicit temporary
             *      \code
             *          //nb: lock lasts til end of enclosing scope
             *          auto    lockedConfigData = fConfig_.rwget ();
             *          T       value = lockedConfigData;
             *          value.SomeValueChanged = 1;
             *          lockedConfigData.store (value);
             *      \endcode
             *
             *  or, because Synchronized<> has lock/unlock methods, it can be used with a lock_guard (if associated mutex recursive), as in:
             *      \code
             *          auto&& critSec = lock_guard{n};
             *          // lock to make sure someone else doesn't change n after we made sure it looked good
             *          if (looks_good (n)) {
             *              String a = n;
             *              a = a + a;
             *              n.store (a);
             *          }
             *      \endcode
             *
             *  \note   We consider supporting operator-> for Synchonized<> - and overloading on const to see if we use a Read Lock or a Write lock.
             *          The problem is - that IF its called through a non-const object, it will select the non-const (write lock) even though all that
             *          was needed was the read lock! So this paradigm - though more terse and clear - just encourages inefficient coding (so we
             *          have no read locks - all locks write locks).
             *
             *          So ONLY support operator-> const overload (brevity and more common than for write). To write - use rwget().
