 *      @todo   Consider if there is a need for timed mutexes.
 *              Reviewed 2014-02-09, and I'm pretty sure not needed.
 *
 *      @todo   Consider doing an #if qPlatform_Windows implemeantion using Windows 'CreateEvent'. I had this in Stroika
 *              circa 2013-06-01, and could just grab that implementation (really pretty simple).
 *
 *              But unless there is a performance or other such issue, it maybe better to stick to a single portable
 *              implementation.

     *              other similar classes are not.
     *              and you can easily use shared_ptr<> on an WaitableEvent to make it copyable.

     *
     *  @see    qExecution_WaitableEvent_SupportWaitForMultipleObjects
     *
     *      This appears to be an issue with strong arguments on both sides. I'm very uncertain.
     *
     *      I've used the Windows WaitForMutlipleObjects API for years, and feel pretty comfortable with it.
     *      I find it handy.
     *
     *      However, there are compelling arguments (for example):
     *          https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.unix.programmer/q2x0yQR5txk/34v1qQZN_u0J
     *          https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.unix.programmer/WsgZZmu4ESA/Rv1MCun1CmUJ
     *
     *      which argue that its a bad idea, and that it leads to bad programming (bugs).
     *
     *      To some extent I we may have addressed the reported concerns by having WaitForAny/WaitForAnyUntil
     *      return the full set of events that were signaled (and the issue about races I don't think applies
     *      to WaitForAll).
     *
     *      Note also that some recommend using the BlockingQueue<> pattern to avoid WaitForMultipleObjects (WaitForAny)
     *      such as:
     *              http://stackoverflow.com/questions/788835/waitformultipleobjects-in-java
     *      Stroika supports this sort of BlockingQueue<>
     *
     *      Note - WaitForAny() takes a templated SET because I don't want to create interdependency
     *      with Containers and something this low level, and yet we want to make it easy for users of this
     *      to use Stroika Set<> objects.
