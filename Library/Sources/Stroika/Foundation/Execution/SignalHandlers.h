/**
 * Description:
 *
 *      This module defines support for POSIX (and std c++ defined) Signals (not to be confused
 *  with the 'Signals and slots' design pattern which is largely unrelated).
 *
 *
 * TODO:
 *
 *      @todo   https://stroika.atlassian.net/browse/STK-467 Lose shared_ptr<> with SignalHandlerRegistry::SafeSignalsManager::Rep_
 *              and change semantics - assert or autodelete - safe handlers on destory of safe signal mgr.
 *
 *      @todo   REDO operator== etc using non-member functions
 *              (see See coding conventions document about operator usage: Compare () and operator<, operator>, etc comments)
 *
 *      @todo   Small issue - AddSignalHandler versus SetSignalHandler (). This can be confusing. I had a bug
 *              which was we setup DEFAULT signal handlers, and then in the BasicUNIX Serviced code - did
 *              AddSignalHandler (SIGINT). Issue is that we process BOTH hanlders - one to set an event
 *              object to cleanly shutodown and the other to HARD ABORT!
 *
 *              This API encourages that mistake. I changed the Service code to use SetSignalHandler - but
 *              That has the default of being hard to debug/non-modular. Maybe have a "SetDefaultHanlder"
 *              or "SetFallbackHandler" - and that is invoked ONLY if no others? Or maybe a property of all
 *              handlers?
 *
 *      @todo   Consider use of threadpool for SafeSignalsManager
 *              Good idea since we may need to handle signals quickly so as to not overflow
 *              fixed size incoming buffer.
 *
 *      @todo   Do overload (or some such) for (sa_sigaction)(int, siginfo_t *, void *); Allow
 *              these to be (more or less) interchangable with regular SignalHandler.
 *
 *      @todo   Consider adding "ThreadSignalHandler" facility - where we register a set of handlers
 *              that ONLY apply when the signal is sent to the given (argument with register) thread.
 *              If we do this - we will want to write cooperating code with the thread start/end
 *              stuff so these get cleared out appropriately.
 *              Consider how this might be useful for stuff like SIGPIPE handling?
