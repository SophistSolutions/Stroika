 * TODO:
 *      @todo   https://stroika.atlassian.net/browse/STK-600
 *              Rename this to InterruptibleMutex - and simple wrapper around any existing timed mutex, but with args
 *              saying time freq to check, and automatically so try with shorter timeouts.
 *
 *      @todo   TOTALLY UNTESTED
 *
 *      @todo   May need (want) to add try_lock etc (Lockable versus BasicLockable)
 *
 *      @todo   Initial implementation is inefficent (using timed_mutex). COULD do #ifdef based
 *              more efficient impls, directly using pthread_mutex (since it returns on EINTR) I think.
 *
 *              Not SURE how todo better with MSFT - but I'm sure they have some alertable API that
 *              comes down to a mutex (or close)
 *
 *              But this is a good enough start -- good enuf to test if this fixes any issues and is
 *              a reasonable placeholder.
 *
 *      @todo   Need AbortableRecursiveMutex, and possibly AbortableTimedMutex, and AbortableTimedRecursiveMutext.
 *
 *      @todo   Add regtests for this
 *
 *      @todo   make NOT copyable - /moveable etc - just like std::mutex (for docs - autodone by priovate fM_).
 *
 * Notes:
 *

     *  block/lock for an extended time, it makes sense to use this instead. This is compeltely
