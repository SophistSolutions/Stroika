                     * This can be used to create a readable stream of strings (readline) - which
                     * consume a BinaryStream (pre-seeked to the right place) - as a series of characters.
                     *
                     * This code respects the format defined in http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html
                     * and doesnt read more than needed (no pre-buffering).
                     * This lack of pre-buffering (peeking) is critical so that the underlying binary stream
                     * only reads the minimal amount needed and will be placed at the right position when handed
                     * to the next process to interpret.
                     *
                     *  Though this InputStream<Character>::Ptr is seekable, it only supports seeking backwards over materials
                     *  already read. It never allows seeking past its last read point (throws not supported).
                     *
                     *  This adpater defines 0 seek offset as the point at which its constructed. And then you can seek to any locaiton
                     *  0 .. up to the max point ever read (with Read).
