                 *  A Socket has two parts, a _IRep*, and a smart pointer wrapper (like shared_ptr <_IRep>).
                 *  Users of the class interact only with the smart pointer wrapper.
                 *
                 *  But for purposes of thread safety, and understanding object lifetime, its important
                 *  to consider both.
                 *
                 *  The Socket class itself is abstract - as you can only create particular kinds of sockets (like connection-oriented etc).
                 *
                 *  And you almost always just interact with and manage the smart pointers - Socket::Ptr.
                 *
                 *  But you construct a concrete subtype and assign it to a pointer. 
                 *
                 *  \par Example Usage
                 *      \code
                 *          Socket::Ptr      s  = ConnectionlessSocket { Socket::INET, Socket::DGRAM };
                 *      \endcode
                 *
                 *  The Socket smart pointer objects can be freely assigned and passed around, but the
                 *  underlying (_IRep*) socket is finally disposed of when the last reference to it
                 *  goes away (or when it is 'Closed').
                 *
                 *  Closing one, closes them all (though overwriting one just has the effect of detatching
                 *  from the underlying socket.
                 *
                 * TODO:
                 *      @todo   In socket class, set CLOSE_ON_EXEC?
                 *
                 *      @todo   Document (or define new expcetion) thrown when operaiton done on CLOSED socket.
                 *              and acutally handle all the nullptr cases...
