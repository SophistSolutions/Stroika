/**
 * TODO:

 *      @todo   Consdier if we should have variants of these funtions taking a locale, or
 *              always using C/currnet locale. For the most part - I find it best to use the C locale.
 *              But DOCUMENT in all cases!!! And maybe implement variants...
 *
 *      @todo   See if I can come up with a more flexibe and/or typesafe variant of Format using
 *              variadic templates? Maybe using a nicer syntax widely done in ruby/C# etc, like
 *              Format ("{1}{3}", "x", 3);??? VERY INCHOATE THOUGHTS HERE...

/**
@CONFIGVAR:     qStdLibSprintfAssumesPctSIsWideInFormatIfWideFormat
@DESCRIPTION:   Very surprising difference between Microsoft of Linux interpretations of sprintf(). It appears the Linux/gcc approach was
                blessed by ISO - and so is now 'correct'. But no matter, because its so fundementally different, they will have a difficult
                time changing.

                The issue is - for sprintf - and in our case vswprintf - what is the interpretation of '%s'. Does this match a char* or
                wchar_t* string in the argument list?

                According to Microsoft, it would appear to match wchar_t*.
                    From http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ybk95axf(v=vs.71).aspx:
                    int main( void )
                    {
                       wchar_t buf[100];
                       int len = swprintf( buf, L"%s", L"Hello world" );
                       printf( "wrote %d characters\n", len );
                       len = swprintf( buf, L"%s", L"Hello\xffff world" );
                       // swprintf fails because string contains WEOF (\xffff)
                       printf( "wrote %d characters\n", len );
                    }

                But according to http://www.tin.org/bin/man.cgi?section=3&topic=vsnprintf:
                      s      If  no  l  modifier  is  present:  The  const char * argument is
                              expected to be a pointer to an array of character type  (pointer
                              to  a string).  Characters from the array are written up to (but
                              not including) a terminating null byte ('\0'); if a precision is
                              specified,  no more than the number specified are written.  If a
                              precision is given, no null byte need be present; if the  preci-
                              sion is not specified, or is greater than the size of the array,
                              the array must contain a terminating null byte.

                              If an l modifier is present: The const  wchar_t  *  argument  is
                              expected  to  be a pointer to an array of wide characters.  Wide
                              characters from the array are converted to multibyte  characters
                              (each  by  a  call  to the wcrtomb() function, with a conversion
                              state starting in the initial state before the first wide  char-
                              acter),  up  to and including a terminating null wide character.
                              The resulting multibyte characters are written up  to  (but  not
                              including)  the  terminating null byte. If a precision is speci-
                              fied, no more bytes than the number specified are  written,  but
                              no  partial multibyte characters are written. Note that the pre-
                              cision determines the number of bytes written, not the number of
                              wide  characters  or screen positions.  The array must contain a
                              terminating null wide character, unless a precision is given and
                              it  is  so  small  that  the  number of bytes written exceeds it
                              before the end of the array is reached.

             * Format is the Stroika wrapper on sprintf().
             * The main differences between sprintf () and Format are:
             *      (1)     No need for buffer management. ANY sized buffer will be automatically allocated internally and returned as a
             *              string (eventually probably using Stroika::String - but for now std::string).
             *
             *      (2)     This version of format has a SUBTLE - but important difference from std::c++ / sprintf() in the interpretation of
             *              %s format strings in Format(const wchar_t*).  The interpretation of Format (const char*,...) is the same
             *              but for Format (const wchar_t* format, ...) - %s is assumed to match a const wchar_t* string in the variable
             *              argument list.
             *
             *              This deviation from the c++ standard (technically not a deviation because Stroika::Foundation::Characters::Format() isn't
             *              covered by the stdc++ ;-)) - is because of two reasons:
             *                  a)  Microsoft has this interpretation.
             *                  b)  Its a BETTER interpretation (allowing for stuff like (Format (SDKSTR("time%s"), count==1? SDKSTR (""): SDKSTR ("s"));
