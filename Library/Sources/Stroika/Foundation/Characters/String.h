 * Description:
 *
 *      This family of classes using something akin to the Letter/Envelope paradigm
 *      described in Copliens "Advanced C++ Programming Styles and Idioms").
 *
 *      The class String () is the main thing that users of this class will see. In
 *      fact, it would be EXTREMELY unusual to interact with the class String in any
 *      other way. However, as part of the internal implementation, and in some cases
 *      for optimizations in places where an alternate text representation is preferred,
 *      there may be some interest in the "letters" inside of Strings.
 *
 *      The class that String's own is a reference counted pointer to String::Rep.
 *      This class is abstract, and defines a protocol for getting at the string data
 *      (Character*) and for getting/setting the string length. All the rest of the
 *      String class is built in this interface, and subclasses of String::Rep only
 *      needed follow that prootcol to be used interchangably with the rest of Strings.
 *
 *      This is which NEED be used. However, Stroika provides several String SUBTYPES
 *      which act EXACTLY like a String, but offer different performance behaviors.
 *
 *              o   String_BufferedArray
 *              o   String_ExternalMemoryOwnership_ApplicationLifetime_ReadOnly     (aka String_Constant)
 *              o   String_ExternalMemoryOwnership_ApplicationLifetime_ReadWrite
 *              o   String_ExternalMemoryOwnership_StackLifetime_ReadOnly
 *              o   String_ExternalMemoryOwnership_StackLifetime_ReadWrite
 *              o   String_wstring
 *
 *      Possible future additions
 *              o   String_Common
 *              o   String_AsciiOnlyOptimized
 *
 * TODO:
 *
 *      @todo   The string REPS are (I think) fully threadsafe, but I dont think the String envelope class is.
 *              We need to be much more careful about the Envelope class thread safety.
 *
 *              For example,
 *
 *              String  String::StripAll (bool (*removeCharIf) (Character)) const
 *              {
 *                  ...
 *                  size_t  n   =   GetLength ();
 *                  for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
 *                      Character   c   =   operator[] (i);
 *              ...
 *              What if someone changed the length in the middle of the loop!
 *
 *      @todo   Annotate basic string aliases as (std::basic_string alias - as below). At least try and think
 *              through if this seems ugly/pointless.
 *
 *      @todo   Add AsSDKString(TCHAR BUF) overload - as performance tweek. Not sure can be easily done safely so
 *              not sure of this, but could be a significant performance advantage. Test more...
 *
 *              Maybe better - AsTChar* - which takes BUFFER arg. And OPTIONALLY uses that buffer arg (depending
 *              on sizeof TCHAR???
 *
 *              Or maybe better - just change code that uses TSTring version of APIs to use W version of APIS!!!
 *              I THINK THAT IS BEST!
 *
 *      @todo   Add FromISOLatin1()
 *
 *      @todo   Performance optimize FromUTF8, and AsUtf8() functions to not go through intermediate string
 *              objects!
 *
 *      @todo   Redo SetLength() API, so caller must specify fill-character.
 *              Or maybe better yet - replace with two APIs
 *                  GrowToLength(n, fillChar)
 *                  ShriunkToLength(n) - AKA Qt::QString::truncate().
 *              Not an error if nothing todo (even if already longer/shorter).
 *
 *      @todo   Add #include of Comparer and template specialize Comparer for String??? Maybe
 *              Maybe not needed. Or maybe can avoid the #include and just do template specailizaiton?
 *
 *      @todo   WHEN we have String_stdwstring implemented  - we can do String (wstring&& ctor that
 *              does std::move of wstring - and builds String_stdwstring rep! That could be notably
 *              faster for constructing Strings from wstring - in some cases...
 *
 *      @todo   Add a String_AsciiOnlyOptimized or String_isolatin1Optimized class (instead of String_UTF8).
 *              Idea is THIS can be very efficient and we can detect automatically when to create in
 *              normal string CTOR (i think - if strlen > 3? - check if all ascii and do).
 *
 *              This will automatically morph to other class (like buffered as we do for readonly). Maybe that
 *              means we need a backend, but no front-end?
 *
 *              OBSOLETE TODO
 *                  Consider adding a new subtype of string - OPTIMIZAITON - which takes an ASCII argument (so can do less checking
 *                  and be more compact??? Perhaps similarly for REP storing stuff as UTF8?
 *
 *                  CLOSELY RELATED - MAYBE DO part of above (no check CTOR except assert).
 *
 *      @todo   We want String : public Iterable<Character>. Verify easy and has no overhead!
 *              Document we chose NOT to have String : Sequence<Character> - because of issue of assignemtn to
 *              members? Maybe not good enough reason? But would muck up API more. Maybe revisit that?
 *
 *              OBSOLETE RELATED TODO
 *                  Somehow make it easy to convert String to an Iterable<Character> - and perhaps even Sequence<Character>
 *                  Should be able to do for (Character c : s) {...}.
 *
 *      @todo   Think out and document the whole choice about 'readonly' strings and all modifying member
 *              functions returning a new string. Has performance implications, but also usability.
 *              Not sure what way to go (probably do it), but clearly document!!! And docment reasons.
 *              Maybe can be done transparently with envelope (maybe already done?)
 *
 *      @todo   RFind() API should be embellished to include startAt etc, like regular Find () - but not 100%
 *              sure - think through...
 *
 *      @todo   Document better what APIs CHANGE the string, and what APIs have no effect. Verbs like
 *              "ToLowerCase" are AMBIGUOUS.
 *
 *      @todo   CLEANUP Tokenize API, AND VERY IMPROTANMTLY - either DOCUMENT or indirect to Tokenize() API.
 *              MANY people will expect a String.Split() function to exist. This is what the existing TOKENIZE() API does but thats
 *              not obvious!!!! MUST BE SUPER CLEARLY DOCUMENTED.
 *              Be sure docs for TOKENIZE are clear this is not a FLEX replacement - but just a very simple 'split' like functionaliuty.
 *              not totally clear what name is best (split or tokenize()).
 *
 *              Closely related to my existing FIND () API. Maybe this is just a comment?
 *
 *              But also review:
 *                  http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtcore/qstring.html#split
 *
 *                  especially:
 *                      QString line = "forename\tmiddlename  surname \t \t phone";
 *                      QRegularExpression sep("\\s+");
 *                      str = line.section(sep, 2, 2); // str == "surname"
 *                      str = line.section(sep, -3, -2); // str == "middlename  surname"
 *              Make sure our FIND is at least this simple, and maybe diff between find and split is FIND the regular expression names the things
 *              looked for and SPLIT() uses regexp to name the separators?
 *
 *              Add something like the above to the String String demo app (when it exists)
 *
 *      @todo   MAYBE also add ReplaceOne() function (we have ReplaceAll() now).
 *
 *      @todo   At this stage - for our one trivial test - performance is now about 5% faster than
 *              visual studio.net 2010, but
 *              about a factor of 2 SLOWER than GCC (as of 2011-12-04).
 *
 *              I SUSPECT the next big change to address this will be && MOVE OPERATOR support.
 *
 *      @todo   Fix const   Memory::SharedByValue<String::String::Rep>  String::kEmptyStringRep_ (new String_CharArray::MyRep_ (nullptr, 0), &String::Clone_);
 *              to properly handle cross-module startup (not safe as is - probably use ModuleInit<> stuff. OR use static intit PTR and assure its fixed
 *              just in CPP file
 *
 *      @todo   Move DOCS in the top of this file down to the appropriate major classes - and then review the implemantion and make sure
 *              it is all correct for each (especially SetStorage () sutff looks quesitonable)
 *
 *      @todo   String::Remove()
 *              CRAPPY API - probably delete or redo. See if ever used!!! RemoveAll or RemoveFirst() would be
 *              better names (thogh all woudl be a change in functionality) - and maybe return a bool so
 *              you can tell if it did anyhting? Also - make case match an optional param.
 *
 *      @todo   Use new CopyTo() method to get rid of MOST of the casts/memcpy code in the implementation
 *
 *      @todo   Try and get rid of the Peek () API
 *
 *              OR better document why its OK (unexpected throw stuff may make it OK).
 *
 *              Maybe also add GetRepSupportedFeatures() API? Maybe not worth it. If no - dumcument why someplace!
 *
 *      @todo   WRITEUP THREAD SAFETY:
 *              Writeup in docs STRINGS THREADING SAFETY setioN (intenral hidden stuff fully threadsafe,
 *              but externally, envelope cannot be read/write or write/write at the same time). – document examples.
 *
 *      @todo   Add Ranged insert public envelope API, and add APPEND (not just operaotr+) API. See/maybe use new
 *              Stroika Range type?
 *
 *      @todo   Migrate most of the StringUtils stuff here like:
 *              > Contains- with CI optin
 *overload so can be string arg OR lambda!
 *              > Compare () - returns < less > more =0 for equal- with CI optin
 *              > Equals() - with CI optin
 *
 *      @todo   Add Left()/Right()/Mid() funtions - like basic (simple, vaguely useful - especially 'Right'()).
 *
 *      @todo   Add NormalizeSpace (Character useSpaceCharacter = ' ');
 *              see Qt 'QString::simplify()'. Idea is Trim() (right and left) - plus replace contiguous substrings with
 *              Character::IsSpace() with a single (given) space character.
 *
 *      @todo   Compare
 *          template    <typename TCHAR>
 *              basic_string<TCHAR> RTrim (const basic_string<TCHAR>& text)
 *                  {
 *                      std::locale loc1;   // default locale
 *                      const ctype<TCHAR>& ct = use_facet<ctype<TCHAR>>(loc1);
 *                      typename basic_string<TCHAR>::const_iterator i = text.end ();
 *                      for (; i != text.begin () and ct.is (ctype<TCHAR>::space, *(i-1)); --i)
 *                          ;
 *                      return basic_string<TCHAR> (text.begin (), i);
 *                  }
 *          with the TRIM() implementation I wrote here - in String. Not sure we want to use the local stuff? Maybe?
 *
 *      @todo   Implement String_Common
 *              NOT YET IMPLEMETNED - EVEN IN FAKE FORM - BECAUSE I"M NOT SURE OF SEMANTICS YET!
 *
 *              String_Common is a subtype of string you can use to construct a String object freely.
 *              It has no semantics requirements. However, it SHOULD only be used for strings which are
 *              commonly used, and where you wish to save space. The implementation will keep the memory for String_Common strings
 *              allocated permanently - for the lifetime of the application, and will take potentially
 *              extra time looking for the given string.
 *
 *              We MAY handle this like the HealthFrame RFLLib ATOM class - where we store the string in
 *              a hashtable (or map), and do quick lookup of associated index, and also store in a table
 *              (intead of vector of strings, use a big buffer we APPEND to, and whose index is the value
 *              of the stored rep. Then doing a PEEK() is trivial and efficient.
 *              class   String_Common : public String {
 *                  public:
 *                      explicit String_Common (const String& from);
 *              };
 *
 *      @todo   Add a String_UTF8 backend - (maybe a number of variants). Key is that these can be more compact
 *              and for many operaitons, just fine, but for insert, and a[i] = quite sucky.
 *              [RETHINK - See String_AsciiOnlyOptimized - and probably dont do this]
 *
 *      @todo   Handle Turkish toupper('i') problem. Maybe use ICU. Maybe add optional LOCALE parameter to routines where this matters.
 *              Maybe use per-thread global LOCALE settings. Discuss with KDJ.
 *              KDJ's BASIC SUGGESTION is - USE ICU and 'stand on their shoulders'.

            /**
             *  The Stroika String class is an alternatve for the std::wstring class, which should be largely
             *  interoperable with code using wstring (there is wstring constructor and As<wstring>()
             *  methods).
             *
             *  The Stroika String class is conceptually a sequence of (UNICODE) Characters, and so there is
             *  no obvious way to map the Stroika String to a std::string. However, if you specify a codepage
             *  for conversion, or are converting to/from SDKString/SDKChar, there is builtin support for that.
             *
             *
             *  EOS Handling:
             *      The Stroika String class does support having embedded NUL-characters. It also supports
             *      returning wchar_t* strings which are NUL-terminated. But - Stroika generally does NOT
             *      maintain strings internally as NUL-terminated (generally). It may add a performance
             *      overhead when you call the c_str() method to force a NUL-character termination.
             *      See String::c_str ().
             *
             *      Also note that some subclasses of String (e.g. future String_stdwstring) may not support
             *      internal NUL-characters, if their underling implementation doesn't allow for that.

             *  \note   Design Choice - Iterable<T> / Iterator<T> behavior
             *      We have two basic choices of how to define the behavior of iterators:
             *      o   Live Update (like we do for Containers) - where changes to the
             *          String appear in iteration.
             *
             *      o   Snapshot at the start of iteration
             *
             *      The advantages of 'live update' are that its probably better / clearer semantics. We may
             *      want to switch to that. But to implement, we need to keep the update and iteration code
             *      in sync.
             *
             *      'Snapshot at the start of iteration' can be more efficient, and easier to implement.
             *      So - we do that for now.
             *
             *      Among 'snapshot' impl choices - we COULD do lazy copy snapshot (COW). That would perform best.
             *      But to do so - the way the code is currently structured, we would need to use enable_shared_from_this
             *      so we can recover a shared_ptr in ReadOnlyRep::_Rep::MakeIterator.
             *
             *      enable_shared_from_this() would add costs (at least size) even when we dont use String iteration
             *      (which we didnt even impelement for a couple years, so may not be that critical).
             *
             *      For now - stick to simple impl - of just copy on start of iteration.
