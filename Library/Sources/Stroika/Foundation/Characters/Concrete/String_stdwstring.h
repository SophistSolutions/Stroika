 * TODO:
 *      @todo   Do String_stdwstring() as impl optimized to return std::wstring() a lot saving that impl internally.
 *              Do make this efficient, must have pur virtual method of String:::Rep which fills in a wstring* arg
 *              (what about into no-malloc semantics; I guess taken care of perhaps by this? Maybe not - THINKOUT
 *              but pretty sure we want some sort of String_stdwstring().
 *
 *      @todo   Be sure can move-semantics into and out of String_stdwstring() - so can go back and forth between
 *              reps efficiently. This COULD use used to avoid any performance overhead with Stroika strings.
