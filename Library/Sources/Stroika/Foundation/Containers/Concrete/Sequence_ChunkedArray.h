/**
 *  \file
 *
 *  \version    NOT IMPLEMENTED
 *
 *  TODO:
 *      @todo   Idea is basically the same as Led::ChunkedArrayTextStore. Except that uses a vector of chunk
 *              pointers. It may be better to use a doubly linked list of Chunks? Unsure. Or maybe a tree (stl map)
 *              of chunks, so you can insert/remove them more easily.
 *
 *              The Led (vector Chunk*) doesn't work well as you append lots of data to the end of the sequence (realloc).
 *
 *              DoublyLinkedList of chunks with cache for some 'central' point can allow you to take advantage of typical
 *              locality of reference (searching/udpating in an area), and still have the performance benefits of no
 *              grand slowdown (except if you index outside that region, you get bad lookup behavior. BUt a tree
 *              structure might eliminate that problem too.. SkipList?
 *
 *              One other thing HARDER about this comapred with the old LED code - was tha twe have to handle correclty
 *              manual item construction/destruciton (in Led we used chars and so could leave uninitiualized and not be
 *              careful about move etc).
