Overview
--------
  This folder contains all the Stroika Library Foundation::Containers source code.

  Containers are objects that collect together a related (parameterized) set of objects.
  For example, a Stack<T>, or Set<T>, or Sequence<T>.


Rejected Ideas
--------------
	Make KEYs a UNIFYING concept for containers
		*	Think about somehow making KEYs a UNIFYING concept for containers? Special case of unsticky keys –
			like array indexes? In that sense, a KEY is almost like an ITERATOR. In fact, an interator is
			somewhat better htan a key. 
			*	We may wany Find() to (optionally) return an iterator positioned at the first entry
				(unclear what ++ would do).
			*	We may want a[i] or some rough analog for sequnces to get a sequence – offset by I.
		*	Reason Rejected:
			This really only applies to randomly accessed containers (so not stack, deque etc).
			Though its possible to define for them, not usefully. Its probably better to just keep key as a
			'key' concept for Map<>, and use 'index' - which is analagous - but different -
			for sequence (important difference is stickiness of assocation when container is modified).



No Compact() methods
			Stroika 1.0 had Compact() methods - that could be used to generically request that a container
			be compacted.

			We decided against that for Stroika 2 because

			1>	We COULD always add it back.
			2>	Its just a class of optimziations which makes sense for some backends. But other 
				optimizations make snese for other classes of backends. You can always retain a smartptr
				with OUR type of backend! So really can be added just for _Array<> impls. Note - this
				rationale doesnt work perfectly due to copy-by-values semantics with 'casts' but still
				OK.
