 *  \version    <a href="Code-Status.md#Beta">Beta</a>
 *
 *  TODO:
 *      @todo       Started using concepts on CTORs, but make sure THIS supports the appropriate new Container
 *                  concepts and that it USES that for the appropriate overloaded constructors.
 *
 *      @todo       Stroika v1 had REVERSE_ITERATORS - and so does STL. At least for sequences, we need reverse iterators!
 *                  NOTE - this is NOT a special TYPE of itearator (unlike STL). Its just iterator returned from rbegin(), rend().
 *
 *      @todo       Sequence<> must support RandomAccessIterator<>
 *
 *      @todo       Where() and probably other things should use new EmptyClone() strategy - so cheaper and
 *                  returns something of same underlying data structure  type.
 *
 *      @todo       Add insert(Iterator<T>,T) overload (so works with Mapping<..>::As<...> ()
 *
 *      @todo       Must support Iterator<T>::operator-(Itertoar<T>) or some-such so that SequenceIterator must work with qsort().
 *                  In other words, must act as random-access iterator so it can be used in algorithjms that use STL
 *                  random-access iterators. (FOLLOW RULES OF RANDOM ACCESS ITERAOTRS)
 *
 *                  std::iterator<input_iterator_tag, T> versus ?? other iterator tag?
 *
 *      @todo       Maybe add (back) SequenceIterator - with support for operator- (difference), and UpdateCurrent, and GetIndex()
 *                  Maybe also AdvanceBy(), BackBy() methods. Though All these COULD be methods of the underlying Sequence object.
 *
 *      @todo       Implement stuff like Contains () using ApplyUnti.... and lambdas, so locking works cheaply, and
 *                  so no virtual references to operator== - so can always create Sequence<T> even if no operator== defined
 *                  for T.
 *
 *      @todo       Assure well documetned that Stroika 1.0 mutators are replaced with modifocations directly on the container,
 *                  taking the iterator as argument!
 *
 *      @todo       Document and Consider that though iterator compares with CONTAINER.end () work fine with Stroika iterators,
 *                  other comparisons fail. For example, i < it.end (); and more importantly, constructs like i-s.begin() fail.
 *
 *                  Consider  if we can make this work, or document why and that we cannot. Maybe we need a concept of
 *                  SequenceIterator (like we had in Stroika 1) - which adds operator-?
 *
 *      @todo       Add Sequence_SparseArray<T> - using btree implementation
 *                  it requires there is an empty T CTOR. But then uses btree to store values when they differ from T()
 *                  (implement using redback tree or using stl map<>)
 *
 *      @todo       Add backend implementation of Sequence<T> using and Sequence_stdlist<>
 *
 *      @todo       Make sure that Sequence<T> (vector<T>) CTOR reserves the appropriate size before appending,
 *                  by using type_traits logic to figure out of legal to compare - and see length. Same for
 *                  Sequence<T> (ITER iFrom, ITER iTo) - do re-allocate size if appropriate - can do diff
 *                  iTo-iFrom.
 *
 *  Long-Term TODO:
 *
 *      @todo       Consider adding a SubSequence(i,j) method - like std::basic_string<>::substr(). Make it efficient
 *                  so lazy-copy except on update. Medium/low priority

         *  Having Stroika_Foundation_Containers_Sequence_SupportProxyModifiableOperatorBracket work would be nice. For POD
         *  types, this isn't hard to do well. But for things like Sequence<String> x;, where we want x[1].c_str () to work,
         *  the only way I've found is to use a temp proxy subclassing from T. And that has costs over constant usage.
         *
         *  So unless I can find a better way, leave this off -- LGP 2017-02-22
         *
         *  Made some progress on this, but now the problem is that when you assign, like as:
         *
         *  Sequene<String> s;
         *
         *  String a = s[0];    // eror at runtime
         *
         *  cuz String&& CTOR gets called with arg TemporaryReference<String>, and so but the time TemporaryReference DTOR called, value has
         *  gone away. No obvious way to tell udnerlying value 'stolen' so maybe the sucblassing trick wont work after all.

         * TODO:
         *
         *  ->  At some point in the near future we may add the ability to start at an
         *      arbitrary point in a sequence, and end at an arbitrary point. This
         *      requires more thought though. That functionality is probably not too
         *      important in light of being able to compute the current index easily
         *      in an iteration. Also, it requires more thought how to fit in with
         *      the sequenceDirection. Do we have a seperate constructor speciing
         *      two start and endpoints and use their relative order to decide a
         *      direction? Do we just add the two start and end values to the end of
         *      the param list? How hard is this todo with Sequence_DLL?? If this
         *      functionality is subsumed by smart-iterators, does it make sense to
         *      wait to we provide that functionality?
         *
         *  ->  Figure out exactly what we will do about sorting/lookup function
         *      specification. Stroustrup like class param with somehow defaulting
         *      to op==????
         *
         *  ->  Add SetLength() method. Make sure it is optimally efficeint, but try
         *      to avoid introducing a virtual function. Probably overload, and 1 arg
         *      version will use T default CTOR. If done nonvirtually with templates
         *      then we only require no arg CTOR when this function called - GOOD.
         *      Cannot really do with GenClass (would need to compile in seperate .o,
         *      even that wont work - need to not compile except when called).
         *
         *  ->  Consider patching iterators on insertions??? If not, document more
         *      clearly why not. Document exact details of patching in SEQUENCE as
         *      part of API!!!!
         *
         * Notes:
         *
         *      Note: the decsion on arguments to a Sort() function was difficult.
         *  Making the arg default to op <= would not work since for type int it
         *  wouldnt be defined, and sometimes people define it as a member function,
         *  or taking const T& args. Thus the function pointer type would not match.
         *  The other alternative is to overload, and have the no arg function just
         *  have a static private CompareFunction that calls op<=. This does work
         *  pretty well, BUT it fails in cases like Sequence(Picture) where there
         *  is no op<= defined. Here, we could force the definition of this function,
         *  but that would be genrally awkward and was jugdged not worth the trouble.
         *  Just define your own little compare function that does op <=. Thats simple.
         *
         *      The other approach sterl's been pushing is that of functional objects
         *  described in Coplain, and the latest Stroustrup book (Nov 91). I haven't
         *  looked closely enuf to decide.
         *
         *      Another imporant addition was the CurrentIndex method. This was
         *  decided since it allowed for easy filtering (like only third thru eight
         *  elements, or only odd elements) without keeping an extra index variable
         *  which was often very awkward. This feature will probably be seldom used,
         *  and is seldom needed, but is one of the few things that differentiate
         *  a SequenceForEach from a Sequence (ie SequenceIterator from
         *  CollectionIterator). This statement really comes down to our really only
         *  needing sequence iterators rarely, and mostly using CollectionIterators.
         *
         *  \note   \em Iterators
         *      Note that iterators always run in Sequence order, from smallest index
         *      to largest. Items inserted before the current iterator index will not
         *      be encountered, and items inserted after the current index will be encountered.
         *      Items inserted at the current index remain undefined if they will
         *      be encountered or not.
         *
         *  \note   \em Thread-Safety   <a href="thread_safety.html#C++-Standard-Thread-Safety">C++-Standard-Thread-Safety</a>
         *
         *  \note   Design Note - TRAITS for equals versus COMPARER template param to methods that need it
         *      We experimented (until Stroika 2.0a20 apx) with using TRAITS that were optional
         *      with Sequence<> - and had the equals comparer. This worked OK. The advantage of
         *      having the 'equals' method in the TRAITS was that it assured (for a given instance of Sequence)
         *      that all comparisons/notions of equality were tied to the instance.
         *
         *      The idea WAS that you could even have a comparer that stored data in the instance (we never implemented that).
         *
         *      But this notion of equals has problems for defining Sequence<>::Equals() - do you use the
         *      one from the RHS or LHS?
         *
         *      Plus - making it a template param just added to the syntactic garbage in the template
         *      names (like in the debugger how the names printed out). This is no biggie, but
         *      it wasnt a plus.
         *
         *      So now (as of v2.0a20) - we just have the EQUALS_COMPARER be a templated param to the
         *      methods that need it.
         *
         *  \note   See coding conventions document about operator usage: Compare () and operator<, operator>, etc
         *
         *  \note Note About Iterators
         *      o   Stroika container iterators must have shorter lifetime than the container they are iterating over.
         *
         *      o   Stroika container iterators are all automatically patched, so that if you change the underlying container
         *          the iterators are automatically updated internally to behave sensibly.
