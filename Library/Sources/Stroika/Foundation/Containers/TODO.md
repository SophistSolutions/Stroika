TODO (Foundation::Containers)

	(o)		When this code matures (when we have most containers implemented to first draft level),
			plan is to OBSOLETE/DELETE the Collection code. Make sure the appropraite APIs from
			that code are migrated into the appropriate containers, and see if any additional
			abstractions (like Iterable<T>) are appropriate to extract from Colleciton<T> to
			make shared/common bases.
