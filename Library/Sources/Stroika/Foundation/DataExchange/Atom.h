 * TODO:
 *      @todo   Very weak (performance), first draft implementation of AtomManager_Default.
 *
 *              Instead, store a linked list of BLOBs - and for each BLOB keep
 *              a map<> of strings in each BLOB.
 *
 *              Use that to fairly quickly and cheaply lookup (Intern).
 *              Then change ptrdiff_t to be the pointer to the actual string.
 *
 *      @todo   Better document and define having AtomManagers with custom arenas.

    /**
     *  \brief An Atom is like a String, except that its much cheaper to copy/store/compare, and the semantics of compare are queer
     *
     *  An Atom is a wrapper on an underlying String object. You can always extract the original String.
     *
     *  The name 'atom' comes from LISP, and how it represented symbol names.
     *
     *  An Atom is much cheaper to copy/store and compare than a String. However - note that the compare is NOT the same as
     *  the traditional string compare. One Atom is equal to another IFF the underlying Strings would be
     *  equal. But the < behavior is very arbitrary. The only guarantee is that its consistent for the lifetime
     *  of the ATOM_MANAGER.
     *
     *  Note converting a String to an Atom maybe expensive, but if you can store the values as Atoms, future lookups
     *  with something like a hashtable can be much faster.
     *
     *  Atom can even be used with Set_Bitstring () – esp if you don’t use generic Atom<> but one with its own custom arena!
     *
     *  \em Design Choice:
     *      In some ways, this could be more powerful if the Atom construction took a ATOM_MANAGER as parameter.
     *      Then we could store the pointer, and do wholesale clearing / throwing away of atom names. But to make
     *      that work would have a lot of cost (always passing in extra param to construction), and
     *      tracking that pointer in each atom instance (would have to use shared_ptr to manage lifetimes or somehow
     *      assure lifetimes of atoms longer than their owning manager.
     *
     *      That might make sense todo, but would have a lot of cost. It COULD be done in the future (this API would then
     *      just be a type specialization).
     *
     *      But that's not where we start.
     *
     *  \em Extending Atom type and funky Managers
     *
     *      In HealthFrame, we use 'atoms' for user-defined strings, but specially formatted strings
     *      like C00013044, or H342341 are concepts. Also - the objects returned internally are concepts.
     *
     *      This fits perfectly. You can use:
     *          struct  AtomManager_Concepts {
     *              typedef ConceptKey  AtomInternalType;
     *              static  constexpr Concept    kEmpty = ConceptKey();
     *              static  AtomInternalType    Intern (const String& s);
     *              static  String  Extract (AtomInternalType atomI);
     *          };
     *
     *      and then use for
     *
     *          struct Concept : Atom<AtomManager_Concepts> {
     *              // just constructors /forwarding
     *              Concept () = default;
     *              Concept (const String& s) = default;
     *              Concept (const Concept& concept) = default;
     *              Concept (const ConceptKey& concept) = default;
     *
     *              // and access concept key
     *              inline ConceptKey GetConceptKey () const { return _GetInternalRep (); }
     *          };
     *
     *      AtomManager_Concepts::Intern () just indirects to AtomManager_Default::Intern () and
     *      then differently, and Extract() can look at the fields of the concept key and either
     *      algorithmically generate a name or indirect to AtomManager_Default::Extract ();
     *
     *  @see Microsoft.net String::Intern () - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.intern(v=vs.110).aspx
     *
     *  \note <a href="Design Overview.md#Comparisons">Comparisons</a>:
     *        o Standard Stroika Comparison support (operator<=>,operator==, etc);
     *
     *          Atom's are compared in a way that will NOT in general be the same as print name compare. 
     *          In general, their comparison will persist  for app lifetime.
