    /**
     *  Stroika makes very heavy use of assertions (to some extent inspired and
     *  patternend after Bertrand Meyers Eiffel assertion mechanism). Assertions are logical
     *  statements about function parameters, results, object states, etc, which are guaranteed
     *  (required) to be held true. These logical assertions serve two important functions:
     *  they <em>document</em> the requirements on input parameters for a function,
     *  and the promises made on function return. And they perform this documentation task <em>
     *  in such a way that the compiler can generate special code (conditionally) to verify that
     *  the assertions hold true</em>.
     *
     *  This latter point about conditional compilation is important. If the macro
     *  preprocessor symbol <code>qDebug</code> is true (non-zero), then this assertion cheching is
     *  enabled. If the symbol is false (zero), then the checking is disabled. <b>Of course the
     *  promises must always hold true!</b> But since the checking can significantly slow the code,
     *  it is best to only build with assertions on in certain circumstances (like while developing,
     *  and for much of QA/testing); but for released products it should be disabled so the editor
     *  operates at maximum speed.
     *
     *  Stroika's assertion mechanism is not only present to help debug Stroika itself.
     *  After all, that would have little value to a user of the Stroika class library. It is also
     *  very helpful to a programmer using the class library. This is because nearly all the
     *  parameters passed to Stroika functions are immediately checked for validity, so mistakes
     *  are trapped as early as possible. If you pass bad values to a Stroika function, you will
     *  very likely get a debugger trap at almost exactly the point in your calling code where
     *  the error occurred. This can make debugging code written using Stroika much easier.
     *
     *  Stroika provides four familes of 'assertion' macro functions. The are named
     *          <code><em>Assert</em></code>,
     *          <code><em>Require</em></code>,
     *          <code><em>Ensure</em></code>, and
     *          <code><em>Verify</em></code>.
     *
     *  The family you will most often be interested in is <code><em>Require</em></code>s.
     *  This is because these are used to check parameters validity on entry to a function. So
     *  typically when you see a <em>Require</em> fail, you will find that it is the calling
     *  function which is passing invalid arguments to the function which triggered the requirement
     *  failure. The other reason <em>Requires</em> will be of particular interest to programmers
     *  using Stroika is because checking the <em>Require</em> declarations at the beggining of a
     *  function is often very telling about the details of what sort of parameters the function
     *  expects.
     *
     *  Probably the next most common sort of assertion you will see is <em>Ensures</em>.
     *  These state <em>promises</em> about the return values of a function. These should very rarely
     *  be triggered (if they are , they almost always indicate a bug in the function that triggered
     *  the Ensure failure). But the reason they are still of interest to programmers using Stroika
     *  is because they document what can be assumed about return values from a particular function.
     *
     *  Plain <em>Assertions</em> are for assertions which don't fall into any of the above
     *  categories, but are still useful checks to be performed. When an assertion is triggered,
     *  it is almost always diagnostic of a bug in the code which triggered the assertion (or
     *  corrupted data structures). (asside: Assertions logically mean the same thing as Ensures,
     *  except that Ensures only check return values).</p>
     *
     *  <em>Verify</em>s are inspired by the MFC VERIFY() macro, and the particular
     *  idiosyncracies of the Win32 SDK, though they can be used cross-platform. Many of the Win32 SDK
     *  routines return non-zero on success, and zero on failure. Most sample Win32 code you look at
     *  simply ignores these results. For paranoia sake (which was very helpful in the old moldy win32s
     *  days) I wrap most Win32 SDK calls in a <em><code>Verify</code></em> wrapper. This - when
     *  debugging is enabled - checks the return value, and asserts if there is a problem.
     *  <b>Very Important: Unlike the other flavors of Assertions, Verify always evaluates its
     *  argument!</b>.
     *
     *  This last point is worth repeating, as it is the only source of bugs I've ever seen
     *  introduced from the use of assertions (and I've seen the mistake more than once). <b>All
     *  flavors of assertions (except Verify) do NOT evaluate their arguments if <code>qDebug</code>
     *  is off</b>. This means you <b>cannot</b> count on the arguments to assertions having any
     *  side-effects. Use <em>Verify</em> instead of the other assertion flavors if you want to
     *  only check for compliance if <em><code>qDebug</code></em> is true, but want the side-effect
     *  to happen regardless.
     *
     *  Now when assertions are triggered, just what happens? Here I think there is only one
     *  sensible answer. And that is that the program drops into the debugger. And what happens
     *   after that is undefined. This is Stroika's default behavior.
     *
     *  But there are others who hold the view that triggered assertions should generate
     *  exceptions. This isn't an appropraite forum for explanations of why this is generally
     *  a bad idea. Instead, I simply provide the flexability to allow those who want todo this
     *  that ability. There are <code>SetAssertionHandler</code> and <code>GetAssertionHandler</code>
     *  functions which allow the programmer to specify an alternate assertion handling scheme. The
     *  only assumption Stroika makes about this scheme is that the assertion handling function not
     *  return (so itmust either exit the program, or longjump/throw). Led makes no gaurantee that
     *  attemptsto throw out past an assertion will succeed.
     *
     *  GetAssertionHandler() never returns nullptr - it always returns some handler.
