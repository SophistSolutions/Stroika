 *  TODO:
 *
 *      @todo   We should add a RECURSIVE AssertExternallySynchronizedLock (or CTOR flag??). So we can check diff
 *              threads but allow recursive code.
 *
 *      @todo   Consider LOOSER version of Debug::AssertExternallySynchronizedLock with READ and WRITE locks, and then
 *              in Optional – for CONST methods use the READLOCK variant, and, THIS allows multiple readers, so
 *              long as there are no writers. Then we can make OPTIONAL usage even more efficient, allowing for
 *              Optioanl<> use without synchronized, if all readers, but as soon as a writer gets into the party – assert out!

             *  \brief      NOT a real lock - just a debugging infrastructure support tool so in debug builds we assure used threadsafe
             *
             * This class is used as a 'no op' in production builds, as a 'locker' for a class that needs
             *  no thread locking because its externally synchronized.
             *
             *  This 'lock tester' is recursive (a recursive-mutex).
             *
             *  Externally synchronized means that some external applicaiton control guarantees the seciton of code (or data)
             *  is only accessed by a single thread.
             *
             *  In debug builds, it enforces this fact through assertions.
             *
             *  \note   This doesn't gaurnatee catching all races, but it catches many incorrect thread usage cases
             *
             *  Use this as a BASECLASS instead of directly aggregating, due to C++'s queer
             *  rules about sizeof() and members (all at least sizeof byte), but that does not apply
             *  to base classes:
             *      from http://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3797.pdf: section 1.8:
             *          ...
             *          "Unless it is a bit-field (9.6), a most derived object shall have a non-zero
             *          size and shall occupy one or more bytes of storage. Base class subobjects may
             *          have zero size"
             *
             *  \par Example Usage
             *      \code
             *      struct foo : private Debug::AssertExternallySynchronizedLock {
             *          inline  void    DoStuffOnData ()
             *          {
             *              lock_guard<const AssertExternallySynchronizedLock> critSec { *this };
             *              // now do what you usually do for DOStuffOnData...
             *          }
             *      };
             *      \endcode
             *
             *  \note   Until Stroika v2.0a119, this was a non-recursive mutex, but it is now recursive.
