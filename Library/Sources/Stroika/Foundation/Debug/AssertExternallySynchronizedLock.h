     *  \brief      NOT a real lock - just a debugging infrastructure support tool so in debug builds we assure used threadsafe
     *
     *  This class is a 'no op' in production builds, as a 'locker' for a class that needs
     *  no thread locking because its externally synchronized.
     *
     *  This 'lock tester' is recursive (a recursive-mutex) - or really super-recursive - because it allows
     *  lock/shared_lock to be mixed logically (unlike stdc++ shared_mutex).
     *
     *  Externally synchronized means that some external application control guarantees the seciton of code (or data)
     *  is only accessed by a single thread.
     *
     *  This can be used to guarantee the same level of thread safety as provided in the std c++ libraries:
     *      Allow multiple readers (shared locks) from multiple threads, but if any thread has
     *      a lock (writer), then no other threads my read or write lock (in any order).
     *
     *  In debug builds, it enforces this fact through assertions.
     *
     *  \note   This doesn't gaurnatee catching all races, but it catches many incorrect thread usage cases
     *
     *  \note   This may 'catch' a race by having its internal data structures (multiset) corrupted. Interpret
     *          corrupt multiset as a likely race indicator
     *
     *  \note   ***Not Cancelation Point***
     *
     *  \note   methods all noexcept (just asserts out on problems) - noexcept so debug semantics same as release semantics
     *          Since the DEBUG version will allocate memory, which may fail, those failures trigger assertion failure and abort.
     *
     *  Use this as a BASECLASS instead of directly aggregating, due to C++'s queer
     *  rules about sizeof() and members (all at least sizeof byte), but that does not apply
     *  to base classes:
     *      from http://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3797.pdf: section 1.8:
     *          ...
     *          "Unless it is a bit-field (9.6), a most derived object shall have a non-zero
     *          size and shall occupy one or more bytes of storage. Base class subobjects may
     *          have zero size"
     *
     *  \par Example Usage
     *      \code
     *          struct foo : private Debug::AssertExternallySynchronizedLock {
     *              inline  void    DoReadWriteStuffOnData ()
     *              {
     *                  lock_guard<const AssertExternallySynchronizedLock> critSec { *this };
     *                  // now do what you usually do for to modify locked data...
     *              }
     *              inline  void    DoReadOnlyStuffOnData ()
     *              {
     *                  shared_lock<const AssertExternallySynchronizedLock> critSec { *this };
     *                  // now do what you usually do for DoReadOnlyStuffOnData - reading data only...
     *              }
     *          };
     *      \endcode
     *
     *  \note   The use of explicit <AssertExternallySynchronizedLock> argument to lock_guard/shared_lock
     *          as opposed to
     *              auto&& critSec = shared_lock {*this};
     *          because then the deduced type would be foo (not AssertExternallySynchronizedLock) - which then would have
     *          a lock/unlock method, but they would be PRIVATE. You COULD avoid this by using public base class of Debug::AssertExternallySynchronizedLock
     *          but that would make public an implementation detail that should remain private.
     *          
     *  \note   This is SUPER-RECURSIVE lock. It allows lock() when shared_lock held (by only this thread) - so upgradelock.
     *          And it allows shared_lock when lock held by the same thread. Otherwise it asserts when a thread conflict is found,
     *          not blocking.
