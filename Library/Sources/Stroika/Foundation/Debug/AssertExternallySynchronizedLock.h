 *  TODO:
 *      @todo   Redo multiset impl so can be used LOCK-FREE - at least 99% of the time.... Locks affect timing, and can hide thread
 *              bugs.
 *
 *      @todo   Reconsider if AssertExternallySynchronizedLock::operator= shoulkd allow for this to be locked
 *              by the current thread. Safe to do later as that would be weakening the current check/requirement.

             *  \brief      NOT a real lock - just a debugging infrastructure support tool so in debug builds we assure used threadsafe
             *
             *  This class is a 'no op' in production builds, as a 'locker' for a class that needs
             *  no thread locking because its externally synchronized.
             *
             *  This 'lock tester' is recursive (a recursive-mutex).
             *
             *  Externally synchronized means that some external applicaiton control guarantees the seciton of code (or data)
             *  is only accessed by a single thread.
             *
             *  This can be used to guarantee the same level of thread safety as provided in the std c++ libraries:
             *      Allow multiple readers (shared locks) from multiple threads, but if any thread has
             *      a lock (writer), then no other threads my read or write lock (in any order).
             *
             *  In debug builds, it enforces this fact through assertions.
             *
             *  \note   This doesn't gaurnatee catching all races, but it catches many incorrect thread usage cases
             *
             *  \note   This may 'catch' a race by having its internal data structures (multiset) corrupted. Interpret
             *          corrupt multiset as a likely race indicator
             *
             *  \note   ***Not Cancelation Point***
             *
             *  \note   methods all noexcept (just asserts out on problems) - noexcept so debug semantics same as release semantics
             *          Since the DEBUG version will allocate memory, which may fail, those failures trigger assertion failure and abort.
             *
             *  Use this as a BASECLASS instead of directly aggregating, due to C++'s queer
             *  rules about sizeof() and members (all at least sizeof byte), but that does not apply
             *  to base classes:
             *      from http://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3797.pdf: section 1.8:
             *          ...
             *          "Unless it is a bit-field (9.6), a most derived object shall have a non-zero
             *          size and shall occupy one or more bytes of storage. Base class subobjects may
             *          have zero size"
             *
             *  \par Example Usage
             *      \code
             *      struct foo : private Debug::AssertExternallySynchronizedLock {
             *          inline  void    DoReadWriteStuffOnData ()
             *          {
             *              lock_guard<const AssertExternallySynchronizedLock> critSec { *this };
             *              // now do what you usually do for to modify locked data...
             *          }
             *          inline  void    DoReadOnlyStuffOnData ()
             *          {
             *              shared_lock<const AssertExternallySynchronizedLock> critSec { *this };
             *              // now do what you usually do for DoReadOnlyStuffOnData - reading data only...
             *          }
             *      };
             *      \endcode
             *
             *  \note   Until Stroika v2.0a119, this was a non-recursive mutex, but it is now recursive.
