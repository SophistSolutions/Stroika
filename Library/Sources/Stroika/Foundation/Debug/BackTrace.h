             *  Return a string/printable version of the current stack backtrace. This is handy in debugging.
             *
             *  This function will fail gracefully and return an empty string if needed.
             *
             *  There are cases where one would want to limit the number of 'stack frames' returned - since this is just used
             *  for debugging...
             *
             *  The frames are EOL (line) delimited.
             *
             *  \note - if you've distributed a copy of the program without symbols, you can use gdb to read back symbol names with:
             *      > gdb-multiarch Output/arm-linux-gnueabi/Debug/BLKQCL-Controller
             *        info symbol 0x770368
             *        info symbol 0x1b974
             *      ... etc for each symbol returned in []
             *
             *  \note   to get symbols working on Linux, it may be necessary to link with -rdynamic
             *          This can be done with the Stroika configure flags:
             *              --extra-linker-args -rdynamic
             *          OR
             *              --apply-default-debug-flags
             *
             *
             *  \note   BackTrace () Uses no Stroika classes internally (like String, SmallStackBuffer) etc, since
             *          doing so could create deadlocks in the likely use cases where one would want to call this, from
             *          a low level place where you might have locks.
             *
             *          This DOES - however - however, call STL routines and C-library routines, like string::CTOR {}
             */
