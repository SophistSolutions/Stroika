             *  \brief  BinaryTiedStreams are logically two closely related streams - one input and one output
             *
             *  A BinaryTiedStreams is really two separate streams - tied together into one object. The typical
             *  use-case for a BinaryTiedStream is a communications channel with another process. So for example,
             *  pipes, or a TCP-socket-stream (IO::Network::SocketStream) would be 'tied'.
             *
             *  BinaryTiedStreams are generally not seekable, but if you want to seek, you must first cast to
             *  the appropriate subobject (either the BinaryInputStream or BinaryOutputStream to get the right
             *  stream object, and then seek on that.
             *
             *  Note that this is significantly differnt from a BinaryInputOutputStream (which represents
             *  a single stream that can both be written two and read from).
             *
             *  The input and output streams MAY shared a common shared_ptr<> rep, but are not required to.
             *
             *  Note - this interpreation of the word "TIED" is perhaps misleading different from the meaning used in
             *  std::iostream!
