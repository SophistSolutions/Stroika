/**

 *
 *      @todo   Explain in docs how Stroika streams differ from iostream
 *              o   MUCH MUCH easier to implement your own complaint stream
 *              o   Separarate interface from implementation (thats why easier to implement)
 *              o   Doesn’t mix text with binary APIs. Keeps them logically separate (view as
 *                  you will – diff – if better or worse)
 *
 *      @todo   Redo BinaryInputStream::ReadAll() more efficiently checking isSeekable() and the
 *              precomputing size and doing just one read.
 *
 *      @todo   Perhaps add a GetBytesAvailable() method. This is effectively like converting
 *              blocking to safe read calls...
 *
 *      @todo   Consider adding GetLength() - as an alias for:
 *                  oldOffset o = GetOffset();
 *                  l =  Seek (eFromEnd, 0);
 *                  Seek (eFromStart, o);
 *                  return l;
 *              The reason to add this - as a virtual function - is that it can be more efficient and
 *              semantically pure (multithreading). Do here - not in Seekable - cuz only sensible for
 *              read streams, not write streams. Well defined. Issue is - probably REQUIRE Seekable()
 *              for this. But its possibly sensible even for non-seekable streams???

            /**
             *  \brief  BinaryInputStream is an 'abstract' class defining the interface to reading from
             *          a binary source of data.
             *
             * Design Overview:
             *
             *      o   See BinaryStream for details about memory management, but the basic idea is
             *          that BinaryInputStream acts as a smart-pointer to an abstract
             *          BinaryInputStream::_IRep.
             *
             *      o   All read's on a BinaryInputStream are BLOCKING. If there is a desire to have a
             *          non-blocking read, then create a new mixin interface and through that interface
             *          you can do non-blocking reads, but this Read() method must always block.
             *
             *      o   EOF is handled by a return value of zero. Once EOF is returned - any subsequent
             *          calls to Read () will return EOF (unless some other mechanism is used to tweak
             *          the state of the object, like a mixed in Seekable class and calling SEEK).
             *
             *      o   Exceptions indicate something went wrong - like an IO error, or possibly in some cases
             *          a formatting effort (e.g. if the source is encrypted, and the stream is decrypting,
             *          then it might detect a format error and throw).
             *
             *      o   BinaryInputStream and BinaryOutputStream CAN be logically be mixed togehter to make an
             *          input/output stream in one of two ways:
             *              @see BinaryInputOutputStream
             *              @see BinaryTiedStreams
             *
             *      @see Stroika::Foundation::Streams::iostream for adapters to work with std::iostream.
             *
             *      @see BasicBinaryInputStream for most common stream applications.
             *
             *      @see ExternallyOwnedMemoryBinaryInputStream for a more efficient, but slightly less safe
             *          mapping to streams.
