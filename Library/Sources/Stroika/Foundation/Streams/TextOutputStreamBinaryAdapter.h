 *      @todo   Extend format with eUTF16... and eUTF32, and note that wWCharT could be same as eUTF16/32 depending
 *              on system defaults.
 *
 *      @todo   Seekable case NYI
 *
 *      @todo   Seekable. Should this be seekable? Take CTOR param indicating if seekable? Maybe also conditional
 *              on if arg is seekable? (documentd, but unsure)
 *
 *                  Clarify behavior if src (CTOR ARG) stream is or is not seekable. And also what about if src is not
 *                  seeked to beginning for BOM? Clarify exact semantics!!!

 *      @todo   Thread/Locking...
