 *
 *  TODO:
 *      @todo   Consider if Seek () past end of stream on writable stream should be
 *              allowed. Often - like in UNIX - this works - and you can then write there,
 *              and this creates a hole in the file read back as zeros.
 *
 *              Its easier to DISALLOW this now, and then lift the restriction, and later allow it,
 *              so since I'm unsure, disallow for now. This can always be simulated with an extra
 *              zero write, and it assuming no seek past EOF makes implementations simpler, and
 *              definition more consistent (read).
 *
 *      @todo   Add abiiliy to SetEOF (); You can SEEK, but if you seek backwards, and start writing - that doesn't change EOF. EOF
 *              remains fixed as max written to. DODUCMNET THIS (for text and binary) - and provide a SetEOF() method
 *              (maybe just for seekable streams)? Maybe add rule that SetEOF () can only go backwards (shorten). Then call
 *              PullBackEOF() or RestrictEOF() or RemovePast(); OR ResetEOFToCurrentPosiiton(). Later maybe best API.
 *
 *      @todo   Consider/document approaches to timeouts. We COULD have a stream class where
 *              it was a PROPERTY OF THE CLASS (or alternate API) where writes timeout after
 *              a certain point.

     *  \em Design Overview
     *
     *      o   @See Stream
     *      o   @See OutputStream<ELEMENT_TYPE>::Ptr
     *
     *      o   InputStream::Ptr and OutputStream::Ptr may logically be mixed together to make an
     *          input/output stream: @see InputOutputStream<ELEMENT_TYPE>::Ptr
     *
     *      o   One (potential) slight design flaw with this API, is that its not possible to have legal partial writes.
     *          But not supporting partial writes makes use much simpler (since callers don't need
     *          to worry about that case), and its practically never useful. In principle - this API could be
     *          extended so that an exception (or extra method to ask about last write) could include information
     *          about partial writes, but for now - I don't see any reason.
     *
     *  Note - when you Seek() away from the end of an output stream, and then write, you automatically
     *  extend the stream to the point seeked to, and if you seek back (less) than the end and write, this overwrites
     *  instead of inserting.
     *
     *  Note - Write is sufficient to guarnatee the data is written, but it may be buffered until you call
     *  the destructor on the OutputStream (last reference goes away) or until you call Flush ().

         *
         *  It is generally unneeded to ever call Close () - as streams are closed automatically when the final
         *  reference to them is released (smartptr).
         *
         *  But - this can be handy - in that it allows for exception hanlding. Exceptions closing out an output stream - doing
         *  final writes - cannot be reported if done by destroying objects (cannot throw from dtor) - so Close () assures
         *  a clean shutdown with exceptions being propagated during the cleanup.
         *
         *  \note Most calls on an OutputStream after it is closed are illegal, and result in Require () errors. It is up
         *        to the caller/user of the shared output streams to assure they don't use them after being closed. Note - if that
         *        sounds hard its not: it naturally falls out of normal usage.
         *
         *        The rationale is just that I can think of no useful case where a caller might want to allow writing after close, and
         *        have that transalted into an exception, and this choice is more performant (and could be reversed more easily
         *        than the opposite policy if I change my mind).
         *
         *  \note Close () - and IsOpen () are intentionally duplicated in InputStream () and OutputStream () classes. This is so
         *        you can close down the OutputStream side of an InputOutputStream, and leave open the InputStream side - so it sees EOF.
         *
         *  \note When a subtype stream (like BufferedOutputStream) aggregates another stream, it is left to that subclass
         *        whether or not closing the top level stream also Closes the sub-stream. Typically, if the class designer intends
         *        you to think of the ownership as 'aggregation' - close of this stream will close any aggregated streams, but
         *        if this class is designed to 'reference' other streams, it will not close them.
