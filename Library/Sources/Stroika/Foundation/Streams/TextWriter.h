 *          class   TextOutputStreamBinaryAdapter : public TextOutputStream {
 *          public:
 *              enum    class   Format : uint8_t    {
 *                  eUTF8WithBOM        =   1,
 * ...
 *                  eWCharT             =   eWChar
 *
 *              CHANGE DEFAULT TO NOT WITH BOM..
 *              (I’m NOT SURE ABOUT THIS CHANGE)
 *              Probably REPLACE the 'Format' stuff with the same sort of parameters we passed to our older code converison code,
 *              either a locale, or a code page, and a separate overload with flags for BOM.
 *
 *      @todo   Extend format with eUTF16... and eUTF32, and note that wWCharT could be same as eUTF16/32 depending
 *              on system defaults.
 *
 *      @todo   Seekable case NYI
 *
 *      @todo   Seekable. Should this be seekable? Take CTOR param indicating if seekable? Maybe also conditional
 *              on if arg is seekable? (documentd, but unsure)
 *
 *                  Clarify behavior if src (CTOR ARG) stream is or is not seekable. And also what about if src is not
 *                  seeked to beginning for BOM? Clarify exact semantics!!!
 *
 *      @todo   Consider adding locale feature. if you use narrow string (char* or string) it uses associated
 *              locale. If none, use global locale? Could use codepage instead of locale, but propba
 *              best to have one notion and extract that codepage from the given (or global) locale.(ONLY FOR STREAM OF CHARCTETSD?? Maybe just in WRITER)
