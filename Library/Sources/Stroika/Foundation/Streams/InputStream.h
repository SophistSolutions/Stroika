 *  TODO:
 *      @todo   Sterl requested the 'optional SeekOffsetType' param overload to Read methods(). THis is logical,
 *              but I'm not sure useful. Discuss with him the use cases. We should lose this as its not
 *              actually implemented and we'd need to likewise extend the Write() API to make this consistent
 *              in all likelihood.
 *
 *              But hard to say, as I'm not sure I understood the motivations. If there are motivations, it doesn't complicate
 *              the API and implementation much.
 *
 *      @todo   Should add Close () method. Any subsequent calls to this stream - would fail?
 *
 *              If we allow for that - we may need to have check method - isOpen?. So maybe best to
 *              have flush/close allowed, and anything else generate an assert error?
 *
 *      @todo   Consider making GetOffsetToEndOfStream () a virtual part of rep so it can work with the locks
 *              and be safely atomic (atomic stuff only an lssue for 'Synchonized' stream and could probably just
 *              make both calls inside ITS synchonized lock?).
 *
 *      @todo   Consider making LineEnd format (LF,CR,CRLF, or Auto) an optional param to ReadLine().
 *              Then it would ONLY require Seekable() for CRLF or Auto.

            /**
             *  \brief  InputStream<> is Smart pointer (with abstract Rep) class defining the interface to reading from
             *          a Stream source of data.
             *
             * Design Overview:
             *
             *      o   @See Stream
             *
             *      o   All read's on an InputStream are BLOCKING. If there is a desire to have a
             *          non-blocking read, then create a new mixin interface and through that interface
             *          you can do non-blocking reads, but this Read() method must always block.
             *
             *      o   EOF is handled by a return value of zero. Once EOF is returned - any subsequent
             *          calls to Read () will return EOF (unless some other mechanism is used to tweak
             *          the state of the object, like a mixed in Seekable class and calling SEEK).
             *
             *              Seek called on an input stream that has already returned EOF, may cause
             *              subsequent Read() calls to NOT be at EOF.
             *
             *      o   Exceptions indicate something went wrong - like an IO error, or possibly in some cases
             *          a formatting effort (e.g. if the source is encrypted, and the stream is decrypting,
             *          then it might detect a format error and throw).
             *
             *      o   InputStream and OutputStream may be logically be mixed together to make an
             *          input/output stream: @see InputOutputStream<>
             *
             *      @see Stroika::Foundation::Streams::iostream for adapters to work with std::iostream.
             *
             *      @see MemoryStream for most common stream applications.
             *
             *      @see ExternallyOwnedMemoryInputStream for a more efficient, but slightly less safe
             *          mapping to streams.
             *
             *      o   ReadString/Seekable/PutBack Design Choices:
             *          o   Some common read methods with TextStreams (parsing) - involve some amount of lookahead.
             *              Lookahead COULD be implemented a number of ways:
             *              o   Seek backwards after fetching
             *              o   Special 'put back' variable/API - which allows you to put back either one,
             *                  or a number of characters back into the input Q
             *              o   A special proxy object which stores the extra data, and maintains the context
             *                  of the state of pre-reading.
             *
             *          Each of these approaches has some advantages and disadvantages. Just using Seek() is
             *          the simplest approach. IF all your streams support seeking, there is no reason for another
             *          mechanism. But we dont want to alwys require seeking.
             *
             *          PutBack () is like Seek, but then the question is - do we support just a PutBack of
             *          one character? So only lookahead of one character? That deals with many cases, but not all.
             *          And how does it interact with Seek - if the stream happens to be seekable? And is the
             *          PutBack buffer stored in the letter or envelope class? If in Letter, thats extra work
             *          in every rep (barrier to providing your own stream subtypes). If in the envelope, it doesn't
             *          work intuitively if two variables have separate smart pointers to the same underlying stream.
             *          Reads and writes affect each other EXCPET for the putback buffer!
             *
             *          A special Proxy object is a good choice - but requires the caller todo a lot of extra
             *          work. To some extent that can be automated by somewhat automatically maanging
             *          the proxy storage object in the smartpointer, but thats alot of work and concept
             *          for very little gain.
             *
             *          In the end - at least for now - I've decided on KISS - ReadLine() simply requires it
             *          is Seekable. And there are plenty of wrapper stream classes you can use with any stream
             *          to make them Seekable.
