 *
 *  TODO:
 *      @todo   https://stroika.atlassian.net/browse/STK-586
 *              Should add Close () method. Any subsequent calls to this stream - would fail?
 *
 *              If we allow for that - we may need to have check method - isOpen?. So maybe best to
 *              have flush/close allowed, and anything else generate an assert error?
 *
 *      @todo   Consider making GetOffsetToEndOfStream () a virtual part of rep so it can work with the locks
 *              and be safely atomic (atomic stuff only an lssue for 'Synchronized' stream and could probably just
 *              make both calls inside ITS Synchronized lock?).
 *
 *      @todo   Consider making LineEnd format (LF,CR,CRLF, or Auto) an optional param to ReadLine().
 *              Then it would ONLY require Seekable() for CRLF or Auto.
 *
 *      @todo   Consider if IsAtEOF() should be added to the virtual rep? Easy, and can provide (current) default implemntation. But
 *              putting it there allows it to be much cheaper and its called pretty often (avoid seek logic). Wouldnt change semantics (about possibly blocking).

             * Design Overview:
             *
             *      o   @See Stream<T>::Ptr
             *
             *      o   Nearly all read's on an InputStream<T>::Ptr are BLOCKING. If there is a desire to have a
             *          non-blocking read, then call ReadNonBlocking (). All operations block except ReadNonBlocking ().
             *
             *      o   EOF is handled by a return value of zero. Once EOF is returned - any subsequent
             *          calls to Read () will return EOF (unless some other mechanism is used to tweak
             *          the state of the object, like a mixed in Seekable class and calling SEEK, or a MemoryStream where
             *          someone writes more data to it).
             *
             *              Seek called on an input stream that has already returned EOF, may cause
             *              subsequent Read() calls to NOT be at EOF.
             *
             *      o   Exceptions indicate something went wrong - like an IO error, or possibly in some cases
             *          a formatting effort (e.g. if the source is encrypted, and the stream is decrypting,
             *          then it might detect a format error and throw).
             *
             *      o   InputStreamPtr and OutputStream may be logically be mixed together to make an
             *          input/output stream: @see InputOutputStream<>
             *
             *      @see Stroika::Foundation::Streams::iostream for adapters to work with std::iostream.
             *
             *      @see MemoryStream for most common stream applications.
             *
             *      @see ExternallyOwnedMemoryInputStream for a more efficient, but slightly less safe
             *          mapping to streams.
             *
             *      o   ReadString/Seekable/PutBack Design Choices:
             *          o   Some common read methods with TextStreams (parsing) - involve some amount of lookahead.
             *              Lookahead COULD be implemented a number of ways:
             *              o   Seek backwards after fetching
             *              o   Special 'put back' variable/API - which allows you to put back either one,
             *                  or a number of characters back into the input Q
             *              o   A special proxy object which stores the extra data, and maintains the context
             *                  of the state of pre-reading.
             *
             *          Each of these approaches has some advantages and disadvantages. Just using Seek() is
             *          the simplest approach. IF all your streams support seeking, there is no reason for another
             *          mechanism. But we dont want to alwys require seeking.
             *
             *          PutBack () is like Seek, but then the question is - do we support just a PutBack of
             *          one character? So only lookahead of one character? That deals with many cases, but not all.
             *          And how does it interact with Seek - if the stream happens to be seekable? And is the
             *          PutBack buffer stored in the letter or envelope class? If in Letter, thats extra work
             *          in every rep (barrier to providing your own stream subtypes). If in the envelope, it doesn't
             *          work intuitively if two variables have separate smart pointers to the same underlying stream.
             *          Reads and writes affect each other EXCPET for the putback buffer!
             *
             *          A special Proxy object is a good choice - but requires the caller todo a lot of extra
             *          work. To some extent that can be automated by somewhat automatically maanging
             *          the proxy storage object in the smartpointer, but thats alot of work and concept
             *          for very little gain.
             *
             *          In the end - at least for now - I've decided on KISS - ReadLine() simply requires it
             *          is Seekable. And there are plenty of wrapper stream classes you can use with any stream
             *          to make them Seekable.
             *
             *      o   BLOCKING/NON-BLOCKING Design Choices:
             *          Berkeley sockets have the same API, but a flag that turns the socket from blocking to non-blocking.
             *
             *          This pattern is widely copied, and somewhat of a compelling default choice.
             *
             *          But - it sufers from the grave flaw that when you write generic code or routines, you must write it
             *          to handle both blocking and non-blocking cases, and these are really quite differnt.
             *
             *          Mostly - blocking is MUCH simpler to read/write/debug. But you NEED non-blocking sometimes for efficeincy
             *          reasons (to manage progress through a long operation).
             *
             *          Stroika's approach to this is to essentially everywhere in the InputStreamPtr API, have the methods be
             *          blocking (including seek, when supported). But when you must do non-blocking IO, you can call ReadNonBlocking ()
             *          which mostly tells you if there is any data available to read (and variants will also read it for you).
             *
             *  \note ***Cancelation Point***
             *        @todo not 100% sure we want to require this as part of API - but tentatively lets say
             *        All subtypes of InputStream () must have the Read (and related Peek etc) methods implementation be a cancelation point so that those reads can be aborted.
             *        @todo think out Seek () - not sure about this - but probably

                 *          Never blocks. Read up to the amount specified in the arguments (intoEnd-intoStart), and return Missing/nullopt
                 *          if nothing can be read without blocking, or 0 for EOF, or > 0 for actual elements read.
                 *
                 *      Like Read (), it is legal to call ReadNonBlocking () if its already returned EOF, but then it MUST return EOF again.
                 *
                 *  \note   Blocking
                 *          When we say non-blocking, that is in general ambiguous and to the extent to which clear, impossible to guarantee
                 *          (consider a breakpoint or  mutex lock someplace - say on memory allocation, halting problem).
                 *
                 *          What we mean by non-blocking is that this doesn't depend on data being available from an outside upstream
                 *          source, and that the code will run with the data it has at its disposal.
                 *
                 *          If you really need a gaurantee, use a separate thread to do the reading and a BlockingQueue to pass the data
                 *          from that thread to the caller.
                 *
                 *  \note   Returns Memory::nullopt (IsMissing) means no data immediately and definitely available. But sometimes its not possible
                 *          to be sure, so this could return nullopt/IsMissing () - even when a blocking read could have read something.
                 *
                 *  \note   We may need to abandon this experimental API because:
                 *              1>  It makes building Reps more complicated
                 *              2>  Its not that useful without guarantees of not blocking and gaurantees that when you read and get back
                 *                  nullopt, there is no point in reading
                 *              3>  it is easily workaroundable using a Blocking Queue and another thread to read actual data
                 *              4>  Original mandate for this Streams class module was simplicity of use, extension etc, and this makes it harder.
