    /**
     *  \em Design Overview
     *     o   A Streams is a sequence of data elements made available over time. These elements
     *         are typically 'Bytes' - or 'Characters' - but can be any copyable type.
     *
     *     o   Streams are created, and then handled ONLY through smart pointers. Assigning Streams
     *         merely copies the 'smart pointer' to that same underlying stream. This means that offsets
     *         and underlying data, are all shared.
     *
     *     o   Streams have two parallel hierarchies, which mirror one another, of smart pointers and related
     *         'virtual rep' objects which provide the API which implementers override.
     *
     *     o   Seek Offsets are in elements of the kind of stream (e.g in Bytes for a Stream<byte>, and
     *         in Characters for a Stream<Character>).
     *
     *     o   Two important subclasses of Stream<> are InputStreamPtr<> (for reading) and OutputStream<> for
     *         writing. So that each can maintain its own intrinsic current offset (separate seek offset
     *         for reading and writing) in mixed (input/output) streams, the actual offset APIs and
     *         logic are in those subclasses.
     *
     *     o   Stream APIs are intrinsically blocking (except see InputStreamPtr<> and InputStreamPtr<>::ReadNonBlocking()).
     *         This makes working with them much simpler, since code using Streams doesn't need to be written to handle
     *         both blocking and non-blocking behavior, and be surprised when a 'mode' is set on a stream making it non-blocking.
     *
     *     o   Relationship with std iostream:
     *             Stroika streams are in some ways similar to iostreams. They are interoperable with iostreams
     *             through the Streams::iostream::(InputStreamFromStdIStream, InputStreamToStdIStream,
     *             OutputStreamFromStdIStream, OutputStreamToStdIStream) classes.
     *
     *             o   Stroika Streams are much easier to create (just a few intuitive virtual methods
     *                 to override.
     *
     *             o   Stroika streams are unrelated to formatting of text (@todo what other mechanism do we offer?)
     *
     *             o   Stroika Streams are much easier to use and understand, with better internal error checking,
     *                 (like thread safety), and simpler, more consistent naming for offets/seeking, and seekability.
     *
     *             o   Stroika supports non-seekable streams (needed for things like sockets, and certain special files, like
     *                 Linux procfs files).
     *
     *             o   Due to more orthoganal API, easier to provide intuitive simple adapters mapping one kind of stream
     *                 to another (such as binary streams to streams of text, like the .net TextReader).
     *
     *             o   Stroika Streams are divided into 'Smart Pointer' objects (all you interact with) and the underlying Stream data (Rep).
     *                 Copying an iostream is generally not possible with STL, but with Stroika, it copies a reference (smart pointer) to the underlying
     *                 stream.
