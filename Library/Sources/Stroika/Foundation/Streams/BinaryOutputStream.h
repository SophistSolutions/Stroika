/**

 *
 *      @todo   Should add Close () method. Any subsequent calls to this stream - would fail?
 *
 *              (maybe close/flush ignored).
 *
 *              If we allow for that - we may need to have check method - isOpen?. So maybe best to
 *              have flush/close allowed, and anything else generate an assert error?
 *
 *      @todo   Consider/document approaches to timeouts. We COULD have a stream class where
 *              it was a PROPERTY OF THE CLASS (or alternate API) where writes timeout after
 *              a certain point.

             * Design Overview:
             *
             *      o   BinaryInputStream and BinaryOutputStream CAN be naturally mixed togehter to make
             *          an input/output stream. Simlarly, they can both be mixed together with Seekable.
             *          But NONE of the Binary*Stream classes may be mixed together with Text*Stream classes.
             *
             *  Note - when you Seek() away from the end of a binary output stream, and then write, you automatically
             *  extend the stream to the point seeked to, and if you seek back (less) than the end and write, this overwrites
             *  instead of inserting.
             *
             *  Note - Write is sufficient to guarnatee the data is written, but it may be buffered until you call
             *  the destructor on the BinaryOutputStream (last reference goes away) or until you call Flush ().
