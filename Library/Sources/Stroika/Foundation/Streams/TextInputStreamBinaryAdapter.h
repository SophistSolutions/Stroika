/**
 *  \file
 *
 *      @todo   Cruddy, draft (but technically I think correct) implementation. Really need something
 *              smarter integrated with CodePage stuff - and Binary-Stream-based CodePage API, with
 *              an extra 'state' object to allow for pushing bytes in and getting none, and then one,
 *              or perhaps a pull API, where you pull (BinartInputStream) arg - or lambda - to
 *              pull text from.
 *
 *      @todo   BUGGY with seek fucntionality. We ASSUME we always get called to read with the source
 *              offset at zero. We dont even know that the source is seekable, but we
 *              certainly dont know that!
 *
 *      @todo   Ultimately - do several implementations upon construction, depending on whether
 *              or not the source is Seekable. Maybe also take configuration (CTOR) params to
 *              indicate whether or not caching is desired (required to implement seekability on
 *              non-seekable sources).
