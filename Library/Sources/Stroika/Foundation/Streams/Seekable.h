/**
 *  \file
 *
 *  TODO:
 *      @todo   Consider if Seek () past end of stream on writable stream should be
 *              allowed. Often - like in UNIX - this works - and you can then write there,
 *              and this creates a hole in teh file read back as zeros.
 *
 *              Its easier to DISALLOW this now, and then lift the restriction, and later allow it,
 *              so since I'm unsure, disallow for now. This can always be simulated with an extra
 *              zero write, and it assuming no seek past EOF makes implementations simpler, and
 *              definition more consistent (read).
 *
 *      @todo   Consider making GetOffsetToEndOfStream () a virtual part of rep so it can work with the locks
 *              and be safely atomic.

             * Design Overview:
             *
             *      o   Designed to be a base for TextStream and BinaryStream.
             *
             *      o   Two basic parts - a 'smart-ish' pointer wrapper, and a virtual Rep.
             *          The virtual Rep provides the API which implementers override. The
             *          public part of the Seekable class itself provides the helpers
             *          inherirted by the various Stream subclasses (e.g. BinaryInputStream
             *          and TextOutputStream).
             *
             *      o   Seek called on an input stream that has already returned EOF, may cause
             *          subsequent Read() calls to NOT be at EOF.
             *
             *      o   Offsets are in whatever unit makes sense for the kind of stream this is mixed into,
             *          so for TextInputStreams, offsets are in CHARACTERS and in Binary streams, offsets
             *          are in Bytes. This implies one CANNOT reasonably mix together Binary streams and Text
             *          streams (one combines them by use of a special TextStream that refers to another
             *          BinaryStream for actual IO).
             *
             *      o   Considered doing something like .Net CanSeek (), CanRead(), etc, but I decided it
             *          was simpler and more elegant to just keep things separate and use mixin classes
             *          like 'interfaces' - and use dynamic_cast<> to see what functionality is available
             *          on a stream. At least thats so for the implementations. The wrapper class - Seekable -
             *          does have an IsSeekable() method which just tests if we have a Seekable interface.
             *
             *      o   COULD have allowed for GetOffset() to work separately from Seek () - but decided
             *          this was a simpler API, and I could think of no cases where it was particularly
             *          useful to track a 'seek offset' but not be able to Seek() - and if it is useful -
             *          its easy enuf to do another way (e.g. wrap the stream you are using, and track
             *          read calls to it and increment your own offset).
