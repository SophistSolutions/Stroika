             **** @todo NOTE - MAJOR API deparature - combined old BinaryInputOutputStream with binaryTiedStream - so now
             *   we COULD have two sides related as in MemoryBuffer/BasicInputOutputStream - write from one side read from the other, or
             * more unrelated - like socket stream - where write on one side read by other system (often other computer) but two still somehow
             * logically related. Very little though in relation between the two.


              *  \brief  BinaryInputOutputStream is a stream that acts much as a BinaryInputStream and an BinaryOutputStream.
              *
              *  BinaryInputOutputStream might have inherited from BinaryInputStream and
              *  BinaryOutputStream, but then it would have had two copies of the shared_ptr. It seemed
              *  more economical to have just one such base, and make it easy to convert (conversion operator).
              *
              *  A BinaryInputOutputStream is a *combined* input and output stream. That means they are
              *  somehow related. If the BinaryInputOutputStream is seekable, then the same seek offset
              *  applies to BOTH the input and output sides. If you wish to have separate seek offsets,
              *  maintain two separate input and output stream objects.
              *
              *  Note that this concept applies to a file, but NOT to a socket (tcp) stream. A TCP/stream
              *  really consists of two related (paired) streams going in opposite directions.
              *
              *  Note: @BufferedBinaryInputStream and @BufferedBinaryOutputStream may not work as expected with
              *  @BinaryInputOutputStream (and subclasses), because the buffering in individual streams may not get
              *  pushed through to the associated other direction stream. For most predictable buffering results
              *  use @BufferedBinaryInputOutputStream



              OLD OBSOLETE MOSLTY WRONG DOCS FROM BINARYTIEDSTREAM
             * @todo CLEANUP
              *
              *  \brief  BinaryTiedStreams are logically two closely related streams - one input and one output
              *
              *  A BinaryTiedStreams is really two separate streams - tied together into one object. The typical
              *  use-case for a BinaryTiedStream is a communications channel with another process. So for example,
              *  pipes, or a TCP-socket-stream (IO::Network::SocketStream) would be 'tied'.
              *
              *  BinaryTiedStreams are generally not seekable, but if you want to seek, you must first cast to
              *  the appropriate subobject (either the BinaryInputStream or BinaryOutputStream to get the right
              *  stream object, and then seek on that.
              *
              *  Note that this is significantly different from a BinaryInputOutputStream (which represents
              *  a single stream that can both be written two and read from).
              *
              *  The input and output streams MAY shared a common shared_ptr<> rep, but are not required to.
              *
              *  Note - this interpreation of the word "TIED" is perhaps misleading different from the meaning used in
              *  std::iostream!
