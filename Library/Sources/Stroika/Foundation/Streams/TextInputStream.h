             * Design Overview:
             *
             *      o   All read's on a TextInputStream are BLOCKING. If there is a desire to have a
             *          non-blocking read, then create a new mixin interface and through that interface
             *          you can do non-blocking reads, but this Read() method must always block.
             *
             *      o   EOF is handled by a return value of zero. Once EOF is returned - any subsequent
             *          calls to Read () will return EOF (unless some other mechanism is used to tweak
             *          the state of the object, like a mixed in Seekable class and calling SEEK).
             *
             *      o   Exceptions indicate something went wrong - like an IO error, or  formatting
             *          effort (e.g. if the source is encrypted, and the stream is decrypting, then
             *          it might detect a format error and throw).
             *
             *      o   TextInputStream and TextOutputStream CAN be naturally mixed togehter to make
             *          an input/output stream. Simlarly, they can both be mixed together with Seekable.
             *          But NONE of the Binary*Stream classes may be mixed together with Text*Stream classes.
             *
             *  ReadString/Seekable/PutBack Design Choices:
             *      o   Some common read methods with TextStreams (parsing) - involve some amount of lookahead.
             *          Lookahead COULD be implemented a number of ways:
             *          o   Seek backwards after fetching
             *          o   Special 'put back' variable/API - which allows you to put back either one,
             *              or a number of characters back into the input Q
             *          o   A specail proxy object which stores the extra data, and maintains the context
             *              of the state of pre-reading.
             *
             *      Each of these approaches has some advantages and disadvantages. Just using Seek() is
             *      the simplest approach. IF all your streams support seeking, there is no reason for another
             *      mechanism. But we dont want to alwys require seeking.
             *
             *      PutBack () is like Seek, but then the question is - do we support just a PutBack of
             *      one character? So only lookahead of one character? That deals with many cases, but not all.
             *      And how does it interact with Seek - if the stream happens to be seekable? And is the
             *      PutBack buffer stored in the letter or envelope class? If in Letter, thats extra work
             *      in every rep (barrier to providing your own stream subtypes). If in the envelope, it doesn't
             *      work intuitively if two variables have separate smart pointers to the same underlying stream.
             *      Reads and writes affect each other EXCPET for the putback buffer!
             *
             *      A special Proxy object is a good choice - but requires the caller todo a lot of extra
             *      work. To some extent that can be automated by somewhat automatically maanging
             *      the proxy storage object in the smartpointer, but thats alot of work and concept
             *      for very little gain.
             *
             *      In the end - at least for now - I've decided on KISS - ReadLine() simply requires it
             *      is Seekable. And there are plenty of wrapper stream classes you can use with any stream
             *      to make them Seekable.
