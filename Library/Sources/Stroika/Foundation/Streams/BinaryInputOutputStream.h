             *  \brief  BinaryInputOutputStream is a stream that acts much as a BinaryInputStream and an BinaryOutputStream.
             *
             *  BinaryInputOutputStream might have inherited from BinaryInputStream and
             *  BinaryOutputStream, but then it would have had two copies of the shared_ptr. It seemed
             *  more economical to have just one such base, and make it easy to convert (conversion operator).
             *
             *  A BinaryInputOutputStream is a *combined* input and output stream. That means they are
             *  somehow related. If the BinaryInputOutputStream is seekable, then the same seek offset
             *  applies to BOTH the input and output sides. If you wish to have separate seek offsets,
             *  maintain two separate input and output stream objects.
             *
             *  Note that this concept applies to a file, but NOT to a socket (tcp) stream. A TCP/stream
             *  really consists of two related (paired) streams going in opposite directions.
             *
             *  Note: @BufferedBinaryInputStream and @BufferedBinaryOutputStream may not work as expected with
             *  @BinaryInputOutputStream (and subclasses), because the buffering in individual streams may not get
             *  pushed through to the associated other direction stream. For most predictable buffering results
             *  use @BufferedBinaryInputOutputStream
