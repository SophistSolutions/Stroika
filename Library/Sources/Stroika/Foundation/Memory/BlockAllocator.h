 *
 *  @todo   Consider doing GetMem_Util_ code outside of the context of the lock-guard, and if
 *          we get multiple results, just patch them into the linked list. That way in case of
 *          multithreading (when we're paging in freepool) - we'll do less busy waiting.
 *
 *  @todo   Compact() method could be smart enough to move items in free pool that are from
 *          mostly used up pools to the head of the free list, and move mostly unused blocks
 *          to the end of the free pool, which over time should probably tend to defragment
 *          the pools.
 *
 *  @todo   BlockAllocator<T> could hugely benefit from some optimistic locking
 *          strategy - like in http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3341.pdf
 *
 *          Make sure when we experiment with that - we include it here as one of our first
 *          optimization points!
 *
 *  @todo   Maybe use TRAITS on BlockAllocator to define some stuff
 *          about strategies (options) - like how to share pools?
 *
 *  @todo   Comments generally need a thorough review. Many VERY VERY old - from Led days.
 *
 *  @todo   BlockAllocator<>::Compact ()
 *              o   not sure this is useful, or worth the effort, but since
 *                  Sterl wrote it - leave it in for a while - til I get clearer experience.
 *
 *              o   BlockAllocationPool_<SIZE>::Compact () algorithm uses vector, which could fail if
 *                  we are so fragmented we cannot allocate the large contiguous block needed for the vector<>.
 *                  Catch-22. Maybe find a less costly strategy?
 *
 *              o   I make have broken something in Compact() routine when I transcribed it from Sterl's code.
 *                  never tested (by me).
