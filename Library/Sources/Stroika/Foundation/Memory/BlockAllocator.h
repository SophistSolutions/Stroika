 *
 *  @todo   Consider doing GetMem_Util_ code outside of the context of the lock-guard, and if
 *          we get multiple results, just patch them into the linked list. That way in case of
 *          multithreading (when we're paging in freepool) - we'll do less busy waiting. But, this would
 *          be at the cost of possibly allocating too many blocks when two threads both run out of memory
 *          in the same pool at the same time - though that could be undone).
 *
 *  @todo   Compact() method could be smart enough to move items in free pool that are from
 *          mostly used up pools to the head of the free list, and move mostly unused blocks
 *          to the end of the free pool, which over time should probably tend to defragment
 *          the pools.
 *
 *  @todo   BlockAllocator<T> could hugely benefit from some optimistic locking
 *          strategy - like in http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3341.pdf
 *
 *          Make sure when we experiment with that - we include it here as one of our first
 *          optimization points!
 *
 *          There is now a C++ semi-standard for this, and working implementations (I haven't tried). But my current
 *          lockfree approach maybe better.
 *
 *  @todo   Maybe use TRAITS on BlockAllocator to define some stuff
 *          about strategies (options) - like how to share pools?
 *
 *  @todo   BlockAllocator<>::Compact ()
 *              o   not sure this is useful, or worth the effort, but since
 *                  Sterl wrote it - leave it in for a while - til I get clearer experience.
 *
 *              o   BlockAllocationPool_<SIZE>::Compact () algorithm uses vector, which could fail if
 *                  we are so fragmented we cannot allocate the large contiguous block needed for the vector<>.
 *                  Catch-22. Maybe find a less costly strategy?
 *
 *              o   I make have broken something in Compact() routine when I transcribed it from Sterl's code.
 *                  never tested (by me).

     *  Low-level tool to allocate and free memory from a fixed size/element pool. Very high performance since
     *  no searching or coalescing ever needed, but at the cost of creating some amount of fragmentation.

     *
     *  This API operates at the level of malloc/free - just allocating fixed sized blocks and freeing them.
     *
     *  For easiser use, probably the best approach is to @see UseBlockAllocationIfAppropriate
     *
     *  \note   Design Note: alignas / alignemnt of allocated values
     *          https://stroika.atlassian.net/browse/STK-511
     *          We use sizeof(). We always allocate large blocks which (I htink are always) aligned to the largest
     *          alignemnt required by the system, and we that as an array.
     *
     *          But I think since sizeof(T) is the offset from one elemnet of an array[T] - our allocations will always be aligned
     *          if the first big block is aligned.
     *
     *          To double/triple check, we have an Ensure in BlockAllocator<T>::Allocate () to assure aligned allocations
     *
     *  \note
     *       Assuming the compiler is able to inline the mapping from type T, to which sized pool, there is really no cost in adding more. The reason
     *       to have different type T objects share the same BlockAllocationPool_ is to reduce fragmentation.
     *
     *  \note
     *      To make BlockAllocator more of a plug-replacement for the std-c++ free-pool allocator, neither Allocate nor Deallocate () are cancelation
     *      points.
     *
     *      Making them cancelation points led to too many subtle bugs were very rarely we would have 'terminate' called due to a memory allocation
     *      from a no-except method.
     *
     *  But also see:
     *      @see ManuallyBlockAllocated
     *      @see UseBlockAllocationIfAppropriate
