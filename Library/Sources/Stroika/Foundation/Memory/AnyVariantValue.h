 *  TODO:
 *
 *      @todo   Document (in some overall design doc) - the choice of As<> versus
 *              explicit conversion operator. I THINK the rationale is that:
 *                  static_cast<T> (n) is about the same as n.As<T> () - except that overload
 *                  semantics work better for static_cast<T> (n) - THINK ABOUT THIS - verus
 *                  .As<T> () is somewhat shorter, and more clear, and works with compilers that
 *                  dont have explicit operators.
 *
 *              But I think its too easy to accidentally get conversions with the conversion/cast operator.
 *              That maybe due to bugs/incomplete implementation of explicit conversion operators? But we can always
 *              add explicit conversion operators later, and gradually phase-out As<> usage.
 *
 *      @todo   consider using stuff like remove_references and remove_const to 'normalize' the T type
 *              used here. Might make it a little easier to use.
 *
 *      @todo   Consider making operator T () less restrictive - and work if conertable. But then not
 *              sure how to get the right type (can I do decltype (GetType())??? - in other words make a T out of
 *              the type_info? I think not...
 *
 *
 *  Awknolwedgements:
 *      I came up with this idea before looking at the BOOST any code, but when I thought of it
 *      I first checked out what boost had that was similar. Before implementing, I looked at
 *      http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_54_0/doc/html/any.html

         * \brief
         *
         *  Simple variant-value object, but unlike @VariantValue, this can contain ANY type. That both
         *  limits its usefulness (cannot use it for stuff like streaming to XML because not enough is
         *  known about the constituent types), but expands cases of usefulness - like for example - to
         *  implement a @BlockingQueue<> of Command objects, where you have a bunch of differnt kinds of
         *  commands (objects). The party enquing messages needs to know the types, and the party dequing them
         *  does, but nobody else.
         *
         *  Example Rationale:
         *      Often in more complex applications, one wants to have a producer - consumer system, with type safety
         *      and some kind of generic message routing. For example - consider the idea of the SOAP Envelope / Body
         *      distinction.
         *
         *      This also can easily be constructed with the Stroika BlockingQueue<>.
         *
         *      If you want to have type safety on construction of the shared objects to be safely know about on
         *      two ends (the producer and the consumer) but want to have a layer of software in between that handles
         *      the routing (as with SOAP) - having the ability to genericify an object, and then undo that (could also use
         *      serializaiton) - can be handy.
         *
         *      Note - this CAN be accomplished using templates as the in-between routing layer. But that approach has a
         *      number of defects including:
         *          o   Very complex message routing libraries - all in tempaltes - are hard to use because of bad
         *              compiler diagnostics when there is some mis-match.
         *
         *          o   Code bloat from complex/duplicative middle layers (routing layers).
         *
         *          o   Lack of modularity/hiding - all the template code needs to be in header files to be expanded.
         *
         *      Using AnyVariantValue can be a simple remedy to this. At the message routing (between producer/consumer) layer
         *      you wrap your objects in AnyVariantValue, and then (type safely) unpack them on the other end.
         *
         *  \note   Design Note - Equals and less/greater not supported
         *          Supporting this generically would require a virtual method, and as such, would
         *          be tricky todo without requiring the underlying 'T' type to have an equals method. For now
         *          we can just avoid that.
