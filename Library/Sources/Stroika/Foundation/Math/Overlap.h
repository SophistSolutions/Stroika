             *  \brief  Check if two intervals overlap (including empty overlap if one interval empty)
             *
             *  This overlap algorithm computes if two intervals on a common range share any points,
             *  or if one contains the other. Here we consider one interval contained if it has no
             *  points outside the others range, and it intersects (even at edges).
             *
             *  This is almost like computing the intersection between two intervals,
             *  and returning true iff its non-empty.
             *
             *  The one case one might plausibly consider overlap which this routine does NOT is the
             *  case where two regions touch only at the edges (lhs of one == rhs of the other).
             *
             *  In my experience - this is NOT an interesting case (at least in the case of Led,
             *  a word-processor, that wasn't an interesting case, and it appears to be equally
             *  applicable here).
             *
             *      @see    TextStore::Overlap - from where this function is derived
             */
