    TODO:
    	o	We could use a better top-level organization for these various math-related

algorithms. BUt I guess it can wait til we ahve a few more

    	o	Consider adding new "FuzzyValue" - a value type with a builtin 'error' value. You could use it
    		as a regular value, but with a high uncertainty (infinite?) - it could be treated as an unknown, and then
    		possibly interestingly combined with the Range<> code - to create a 'fuzzy range'?

    	o	Consider adding STDFLOAT analog to stdint

    		Fast_... etc asLeast32, etc
