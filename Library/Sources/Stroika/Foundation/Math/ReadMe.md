	TODO:
		o	Consider adding new "FuzzyValue" - a value type with a builtin 'error' value. You could use it
			as a regular value, but with a high uncertainty (infinite?) - it could be treated as an unknown, and then
			possibly interestingly combined with the Range<> code - to create a 'fuzzy range'?

		o	Consider adding STDFLOAT analog to stdint 

			Fast_... etc asLeast32, etc
