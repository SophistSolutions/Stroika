# Stroika::Foundation::Database::[SQL](../)::ORM

This folder contains all the Stroika Library Foundation::Database::[SQL](../)::ORM source code.

NOTE: as of Stroika 2.1b13, this 'ORM' functionality is extremely limited compared to a traditional
ORM, but I could see no better name (mapping C++ structures to/from relational DB structures).

## Modules

- [Schema.h](Schema.h)
- [TableConnection.h](TableConnection.h)
