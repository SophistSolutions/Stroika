# WebService Sample TODO

- Exception case (divide by zero) - make sure returns 400 error - need ApplicationException class which we catch/propagate
  or some other logic to map.
  MUST THINK OUT GOOD DESIGN - DONT REALLY HAVE ONE

- Add data structures you can use AddCommonType<> for since this is by far the most common usage pattern! Goes before RARE
  CUSTOM pattern (for numbers). Maybe something with array of numbers
  plus: [ vector] [vector]??? Could do but not sure common/good pattern

  Probably better to define new struct FOO {} with some fields, and a collection of foo, and a Set<foo-ids>
  Yes, do a CRUD example - like making 'pies', they have a field flavor, and a temperature, and something OPTIONAL (demoing that feature).

- Need to make it much simpler to wrap code in web service
- Need example of parsing args from query-args
- CONSIDER XML example? (much harder)
- integrating with schema validation

- several examples not documented - playing with different styles - SHOW different styles of writing webservice methods (those that fit and those that dont)
