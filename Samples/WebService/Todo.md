# WebService Sample TODO

- Exception case (divide by zero) - make sure returns 400 error - need ApplicationException class which we catch/propagate
  or some other logic to map.
  MUST THINK OUT GOOD DESIGN - DONT REALLY HAVE ONE


- Need to make it much simpler to wrap code in web service
- Need example of parsing args from query-args
- CONSIDER XML example? (much harder)
- integrating with schema validation

- several examples not documented - playing with different styles - SHOW different styles of writing webservice methods (those that fit and those that dont)
