# Stroika Samples

## SQLite

Demonstrates facilities for creating/updating simple database using SQLite (Stroika wrappers)

- Note - this sample does not teach SQL, and presumes you already know SQL (and sqlite to a degree);
  this just shows you how to easily integrate sqlite directly into your c++ applications.

### Details

- Shows writing to in-memory DB example, and then external file-based DB

- Start with SimpleEmployeesDB (shows basic create/query/etc, using named parameters/bindings)
