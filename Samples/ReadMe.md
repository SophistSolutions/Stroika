ActiveLedIt - a word-processor activeX control. This works only for Windows.

LedIt - a word processor application. It was originally working on Windows,
        MacOS, and Linux, but only the Windows code has been ported and tested
        successfully on Stroika (Led v3.x code it was based on worked on the
        other platforms years ago)

LedLineIt - a text editor application. This version only works on Windows, but it
        was ported from code (Led 3.1x) that also had implementations for MacOS, and
        Linux, and so could be ported/targetted for those OSes without too much difficult.

SimpleLedTest - Test the simple-to-use Led library wrapper code. This can easily
		be adapted to work for MacOS (Carbon SDK) and Linux / X-Windows, but
		this code is only tested for Windows).

SimpleSequenceUsage -
		A simple demonstration of how to use the Stroika Sequence containers.

WebServer	Not started (but I've written this before with basically this code
		so not too hard to write as a demo.
