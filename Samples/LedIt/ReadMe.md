# About LedIt

Ledit is an MFC-based Stroika application, which leverages the Led word-processor library to implement a simple word processor (roughly equivilent to WordPad).

LedIt supports tables, style runs, RTF, rulers etc.

(LedIt used to Run on MacOS/Carbon as well, and could probably be ported to X-Windows relatively easily, but there is little reason at this point).
