LedLineIt is a plain text editor, built using the Led Class Library.

This code is based on the latest (approximately vintage 2004) copy
of the Led library I could find (and port to Stroika). It's currently based off
the LedItMFC application from that vintage, but could be pretty easily extended for
MacOS/Unix (as we have historically done for LedIt).
