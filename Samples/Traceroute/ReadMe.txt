 TODO NOTE/FIX


NOTE works FINE on unix if you SUDO it.
Do better error checking/reporting on unix.
STILL fails on ADMIN settings on windows. STILL could be firewall. Try disabling that and see.
ISSUE is windows firewall. DISABLING that made it work. SO NEED BETTER ERROR HANDLING/RERPTING on windows too and maybe code to auto update firewall.
