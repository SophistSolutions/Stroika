- build html quasar app
  configure - so production build assumes config mechanism works and dev j?? maybe rename
   to builtinapp as env name. But use that one from makefile, and assure then we use config so we get right port number
   and otehrwuise use one from standaline instance of html app - better to debug.

   notes about CORS setting ....


- only buold sample quhas html if quasar installed


- hook into WebServer
- Installer
- Docker container support so builds
- Wrap output into docker container
- do decent openapi file for this sample (not sure best tool)
