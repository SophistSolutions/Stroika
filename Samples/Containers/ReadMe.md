 * Containers
   The container classes are well documented, and examples are provided in the headers/class declarations.

   However, 'containers' sample application walks you through a few helpful examples of how to use the Container
   classes. It illustrates:

   *  **Collection** - the most basic 'modifyable Iterable' container
   *  **Mapping** - a key-value-pair association, where each item is associated with 0 or 1 associated (or mapped) element
   *  **Sequence** - which is best thought of as a vector (though you can implement this with a linked list, or doubly linkled list or other structure quite reasonably)
   *  **Set** - like a collection, but each element can be stored at most one time (attempts to store more not an error - just silently ignored)
