race:pipe

#workaround https://stroika.atlassian.net/browse/STK-677 - sem_post() called from inside signal handler, and can spoil errno	- rare and only seen so far on Ubunt1804 but should affect anything
# REMOVED workaround when I added code that should eliminate the problem in SemWaitableEvent::Set(). Not sure tsan will see
# this as a fix, so must test quite a few times (this was hard to reproduce) -- LGP 2018-12-13

#https://stroika.atlassian.net/browse/STK-647 - possible deadlock/bug detected by tsan (debug iterators and FirstPassSignalHandler_
#since hard to reproduce hard to write/test supressions - want to match on BOTH FirstPassSignalHandler_ AND AssertExternallySynchronizedLock (in one stacktrace)
#NB: This is ONLY needed on DEBUG builds

# tried this suppression and got the error again. TRY NEW SUPPRESSION STRING
#deadlock:FirstPassSignalHandler_*AssertExternallySynchronizedLock

# Ideally, we would match on having ONE of these in one stack, and the other in the other stack, but could come in either order
