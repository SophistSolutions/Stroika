# Stroika v3 - modern C++ made easy

Stroika is a modern, portable, thread-savvy, C++ application framework. It makes writing high performance C++ applications easier by providing safe, flexible, modular building blocks.

Stroika is a layer on top of the Standard C++ Library, with simpler to use (higher level) classes, more safety checking guarantees, and a wider domain of applicability. But those Stroika classes seamlessly integrate with standard C++ classes, and your code can easily use as much of either library as preferences dictate.

Stylistically, Stroika differs from the Standard C++ Library, boost, and many other C++ libraries, in that it (relatively) embraces object oriented abstractions over template-based genericity (see [Stroika-Approach-To-Performance.md](Documentation/Stroika-Approach-To-Performance.md)). The abstraction of type hierarchies is better suited to how people reason, and templates and concepts - while powerful - can be fiddly and obscure programmer intent. Also, Stroika emphasizes separation of interface from implementation: carefully documenting the interface in the headers, and separating the implementation to other files.

Stroika is comprised of 2 layers: the [Foundation](Library/Sources/Stroika/Foundation/), which provides building-block classes applicable to most applications, and a series of domain specific [Framework](Library/Sources/Stroika/Frameworks/)s which provide a rich collection of code in different domains.

The Frameworks depend on the Foundation; Foundation modules frequently depend on each other; but Foundation layer code contains no dependencies outside of the Foundation (except on the Standard C++ Library, and various ThirdPartyComponent libraries optionally included or referenced, like openssl).

## Quality

- Nearly all public interfaces and methods are well documented; implementations are clear and well commented.
- Thoroughly integrated assertions (including thread-safety assertions) help document and enforce usage patterns (without performance cost in production builds).
- Each release is tested with Valgrind (memcheck), Google Sanitizers (TSAN, UBSAN, LEAK, and ASAN), Github CodeQL, and a variety of platforms and compilers, as well as a large body of regression tests (including most documentation examples) to help assure library correctness.
- [Sample applications](Samples/) help show common use cases (like building a web server into your app to deliver web-service content and APIs).
- [Quick start using pre-built Docker containers](Documentation/Building%20Stroika.md#build-with-docker) (for Windows, and Linux).

## Stroika [Foundation](Library/Sources/Stroika/Foundation/) provides

- [Cache classes](Library/Sources/Stroika/Foundation/Cache/) (a variety of different caching/memoizing strategies directly supported).
- [Characters classes](Library/Sources/Stroika/Foundation/Characters/) (simpler to use - especially with UNICODE - Strings class, with functional style mappings, and ToString() utility for most Stroika objects).
- [Container classes](Library/Sources/Stroika/Foundation/Containers/) (Collection, Queue, Mapping, Sequence, Set, and much more, each with rich variety of backend implementations).
- [DataExchange](Library/Sources/Stroika/Foundation/DataExchange/) (VariantValue, rich collection of data format serializer/deserializers - like JSON, XML, object to/from serialization mappings, and much more).
- [Execution](Library/Sources/Stroika/Foundation/Execution/) pattern classes (external process runner, synchronization patterns, blocking queue, thread pools, and much more).
- [Networking](Library/Sources/Stroika/Foundation/IO/Network/) support (high level socket wrappers, Web client fetching).
- Simple, elegant [streams library](Library/Sources/Stroika/Foundation/Streams/), with adapters for cryptography, compression, text transforms, etc.
- Seamless integration (object oriented wrappers respecting Stroika's safety and adapter rules) with many important libraries , including: boost, libcurl, lzma sdk, openssl, sqlite, xerces, zlib (e.g. wrap a compression stream - using for example zlib).
- and [more](Library/Sources/Stroika/Foundation/)...

## Stroika [Framework](Library/Sources/Stroika/Frameworks/)s provides

- [network measurement](Library/Sources/Stroika/Frameworks/NetworkMonitor/)
- SSDP/[UPnP](Library/Sources/Stroika/Frameworks/UPnP/)
- [system performance monitoring](Library/Sources/Stroika/Frameworks/SystemPerformance/)
- [text editing/word processor](Library/Sources/Stroika/Frameworks/Led/)
- [web server](Library/Sources/Stroika/Frameworks/WebServer/)
- [web services](Library/Sources/Stroika/Frameworks/WebService/)
- and [more](Library/Sources/Stroika/Frameworks/)...

## Trade-offs

Stroika's biggest strength is also its biggest weakness:

- There are smaller, more focused libraries that do many of the things Stroika does. Being single purpose is a form of modularity (good) and allows for easy adoption/integration. But libraries that do anything of any complexity must create their own infrastructure for a wide variety of building block problems (e.g. Xerces has its own stream classes, pistache date classes, etc). And if you have two such libraries, they are unlikely to interact seemlessly, and their support classes (for stuff like date and streams above) certainly won't.
- Stroika takes the approach of building its functionality in layers, leveraging other components (e.g. Streams and Containers) in lower layers (as well as standardized C++ libraries). This slightly increases the cost of adopting Stroika for something small (because pulling one thing in pulls many things in), but then pays dividends as you use it to accomplish a second or third task.

## Versions (major branches)

- Stroika v3 in active development (**not stable**), and requires C++20 or later.

- Stroika v2.1 is **stable** (in maintainance), and requires C++17 or later. Version 2.1 also conditionally supports many C++20 features (such as three-way-comparison etc, if available).

- Stroika v2.0 is very stable, and requires C++14 or later. Stroika v2.0 is used to power a wide variety of open source and commercial applications.
