Stroika is a C++ application framework designed to make high performance, 
modern, reliable and multi-threaded applications easier to write.

Stroika is now at the late alpha stage - still underoing much revision - but
very usable, and now used in a wide variety of applications.

Quick start building instructions can be found in
	<a href="Documentation/Building Stroika.pdf">Documentation/Building Stroika.pdf</a>

Looking through the samples is also a good way to start.
