Stroika v2.1
----------

Stroika is a C++ application framework designed to make high performance,
modern, reliable and threaded applications easier to write.

  *  Nearly all public interfaces and methods are well documented.
  *  An elaborate system of builtin assertions (including threadsafty assertions) helps document and enforce usage patterns (without performance cost in production builds).
  *  Each release is tested with valgrind, google sanitizers, and a variety of platforms and compilers. as well as a large body of regression tests (including most documentation examples) to help assure library correctness.
  *  Sample applications help show common use cases (like building a web server into your app to deliver web-service content and APIs). 
  
Versions
  *  Stroika v2.0 is very stable, nearly complete, and requires C++14 or later. Stroika v2.0 is used to power a wide variety of open source and commercial applications.

  *  Stroika v2.1 is more actively evolving, and requires C++17 or later.
