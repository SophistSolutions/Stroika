Stroika is a modern C++ class library designed to make high performance, 
reliable and multi-threaded applications easier to write.

Stroika is now at the late alpha stage - still underoing much revision - but
very usable, and now used in a wide variety of applications.

The Samples section is small, but growing more useful - demonstrating
the kinds of applications you can build.
