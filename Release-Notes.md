		<ul>
			<li>New DataExchange::Atom</li>
			<li>Renamed Execution::Event -> Execution::WaitableEvent (old name around but deprecated)</li>
			<li>Draft of AbortableMutex (and list things todo); 
			Lose lose qEVENT_GCCTHREADS_LINUX_WAITBUG, and fixed Event (WaitableEvent) class.
			Net effect is making Thread::AbortAndWaitTilDone() much faster. Lots of related docs/things todo</li>
			<li>make run-tests VALGRIND=1 (and default suppression file - not perfect results, but good)</li>
			<li>make run-tests (makefile cleanups +) REMOTE= (so can run via ssh on remote host)</li>
			<li>Renamed Tally<> to MultiSet<></li>
			<li>Iterator/Iterable cleanups (much docs) - but also deprecated ApplyStatic (use Apply), and deprecated
			ApplyUntilTrue, and ApplyUntilTrueStatic (use FindFirstThat).</li>
			<li>Major speed tweeks (Iterable::Apply/FindFirstThat, and things that use it, 
			and fix to String memory optimization qString_Private_BufferedStringRep_UseBlockAllocatedForSmallBufStrings).</li>
			<li>CopyableMutex is deprecated</li>

<ul>
	<li>renamed Stroika/Foundation/IO/Network/NetworkInterfaces.h to  Stroika/Foundation/IO/Network/LinkMonitor.h, and added new feature to monitor
		network connections, and used this to improve the stability / robustness of SSDP server support.
	</li>

	<li>Leveraging new IteratorOwner code, major backend-refactoring of how we manage patching of iterators
		associated with a container to fix a long standing bug (that iterators must be associated with originating owner
		to preseve proper semantics). That allowed fixing / cleaning up code in Tally<> - that had workarounds for this.
		(note - there was nothing special about Tally<> excpet that it was the first place I implemented sub-iterators,
		where you have an Elements and UniqueElements() iterable that were trivial wrappers on the original base iterator).
	</li>

	<li>Many refinements to SharedByValue code, including variadic template use to forward extra paraemters to Copy, and more sophisticated use of r-value references and noexcept.</li>

	<li>Started adding ...Iterators have a new owner (aka iterable/container) property and refined Equals() semantics</li>

	<li>Lots of cleanups of threads and signal handling code. Improved supression of abort. 
	Improved impl and docs on 'alertable' stuff for WinDoze. 
	thread_local with std::atomic/volatile.</li>
	
	<li>Significant cleanup of templates/containers - using 'using =' etc</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>	
New 'safe signals' mechanism. This is not widely used, but is used
in Services Framework, so users of the services framework (or anyone using safe signals)
should add:
<pre>
	Execution::SignalHandlerRegistry::SafeSignalsManager    safeSignals;
</pre>

to main(int argc, const char* argv[])
</li>

<li>Lose legacy nativive/pthread etc thread support (just C++-thread integration).</li>

<li>Use zlib 1.2.8</li>

<li>	
Experimental new ContainsWith() and EachWith()
</li>
</ul>
