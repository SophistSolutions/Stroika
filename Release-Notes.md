<ul>
	<li>
		Major Rework of thread-safety appraoch. This extends throughout the memory and 
		Execution and Containers and Characters/Strings classes.

		Overall, this was neutral to performance, but intrinsicially slowed things down about 3x to 10x. However,
		I paired the changes with other performance optimizaitons to make up.

		See the tests/Performance regtest (now #46) for details.
	</li>
	<li>
		Tons of further string performance/threading cleanups
		<ul>
			<li>Renamed String_ExternalMemoryOwnership_ApplicationLifetime_ReadOnly to String_ExternalMemoryOwnership_ApplicationLifetime and 
			String_ExternalMemoryOwnership_StackLifetime_ReadOnly to String_ExternalMemoryOwnership_StackLifetime</li>
			<li>String::InsertAt() deprecated, and new (temporary) String::InsertAt_nu which returns String object.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Tons of Iterable/Container thread safety fixes. These currently have a good deal of
		overhead (performance), and we need to fix that. But better they be correct, and then fast.
		Still alot more work todo just DOCUMENTING the thread-safety issues.
		And I did a ton to ameliorate/counter-act the performance overhead of the memory barriers.
		Containers and strings are Slightly slower than with v2.0a21, but only slightly. 
		And I've docuemented quite a few more things which I hope will further improve performance,
		while retaining thread safety.
	</li>
	<li>
		<li>Refactor Containers/Private/DataStructures to Containers/ExternallySynchonizedDataStructures (experimental)</li>
		<li>New Containers/UpdatableIterbale - part of thread safety fixes)</li>
	</li>
	<li>Deprecated WaitTimedOutException in place of new improved TimeOutException, and ThrowTimeoutExceptionAfter is now templated</li>
	<li>SpinLock does yield</li>
	<li>qStroika_Foundation_Traveral_IterableUsesSharedFromThis_ , and use Memory::SharedPtr (and enable_shared_from_this) in several
	ther classes like BLOB - as a performance tweak</li>
	<li>qStroika_Foundation_Memory_SharedByValue_DefaultToThreadsafeEnvelope_ - even though now is big performance sink, probably best in the
	long run
	</li>
	<li>Renamed Execution::ExternallySynchronizedLock to Debug::AssertExternallySynchronizedLock</li>
	<li>
		Lose TRAITS support from Stack<>, Queue<>, and Deque<>, since simpler, and only needed for equals(). Instead, use Equals
		tempalte param on Equals<> method
	</li>
	<li>New DataStructures/OptionsFile</li>
</ul>

	<td>
		<ul>
			<li>Updated license to MIT license (at least tentatively - Sterl thinks this is best)</li>
			<li>New Execution::SpinLock.
				<ul>
					<li>Used in BlockAllocated<> - made a big speedup of regtests (apx 20-100%)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>New DataExchage::INI file support</li>
			<li>BlockAllocation-related cleanups - renamed BlockAllocated<> to AutomaticallyBlockAllocated<> and added
			ManuallyBlockAllocated<>. Other related cleanups.</li>
			<li>Revived SharedPtr<> template (faster, and maybe add future threadsafety option)</li>
			<li>String class changes
				<ul>
					<li>Moving to IMMUTABLE backend design - like Java/C#</li>
					<li>Deprecated String::Remove, and String::RemoveAt - not because really going away, but because changing API to return a new string and
					this will make it easier to avoid code subtly depending on old behavior. DO switch next release.
					</li>
					<li>SubString() used to have default second arg: instead overload of 2 versions. NOT BACKWARD COMPAT if someone
						passed a value > end of string to second arg - now assert error!
					</li>
					<li>tons string classlib improvemnts - maybe fix threadsafty issue</li>
					<li>Lots of performance improvements on string classlib</li>
					<li>Deprecated several concrete subclasses (because going to immutable string design), and use
					StringBuilder instead</li>
					<li>New StringBuilder class</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Fixed long-standing bug with canceling a thread while its starting another. Minor issue but I think
			that was causing some failures of regtests - especailly test 34/threads/gcc/linux (clang++ issue is another issue)</li>
			<li>New Execution::ExternallySynchronizedLock class</li>
			<li>Stroika performance measurements tool and regression test. Little done to improve performance, but 
			at least now we have baseline measurements of some key benchmarks. Motivated by neeed to evaluate costs of
			String threadsafety.</li>
			<li>Math::ReBin() draft</li>
			<li>Duration/Time/etc Range () code now fixed for 'startup before main()' races, and todo comments on how to fix more performantly in
			the future</li>
			<li>SetStandardCrashHandlerSignals() incompatable second argument changes, and improved/factoring</li>
			<li>Duration::PrettyPrint and Lingustics/Word Pluralize etc all use new String class (instead of std::wstring/string). This isn't backward comptable, but close. (so we can use String_Constant in more places).</li>
			<li>Implemented Mapping<>::Keys () and added regtest for it</li>
		</ul>

<td>
<ul>
	<li>Move String_Constant to its own file in Characters/String_Constant.h. Use of Characters::Concrete::String_Constant is deprecated.
		Generally this is fixed by just changing #include of Concrete/String_ExternalMemoryOwnership_ApplicationLifetime_ReadOnly.h to
		String_Constant.h
	</li>
	<li>WaitableEvent changes:
		<ul>
			<li>WaitableEvent now requires a parameter indicating auto-reset or manual reset.</li>
			<li>New experimental WaitableEvent::WaitForAny*</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>new Function<> object - like std::function - but can be used for callbacks</li>
	<li>String class - progress on - but mostly docs - on envelope thread safety</li>
	<li>Sequence<T> no longer has TRAITS support - I decided it was simpler to just pass in equals comparer on
		methods that needed it (template param) - rationale documented in class docs header.
	</li>
	<li>SystemPerformance framework
		<ul>
			<li>Variety of framework clenaups so a more respectable first draft</li>
			<li>SystemPerformance Client now works well</li>
			<li>New Capturer module - used in SystemPerformance Client to demonstrate. Incomplete, but usable.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Factored String2Int<>, HexString2Int(), ... to String2Int.h; String2Float<> to String2Float.h, and Float2String<>(and its related options class) to Float2String.h</li>
	<li>Fixed POSIX GetTickCount() to use monotonic clock</li>
	<li>Characters::StripTrailingCharIfAny deprecated and new String methods to support replacement</li>
</ul>

			<li>New DataExchange::Atom</li>
			<li>Renamed Execution::Event -> Execution::WaitableEvent (old name around but deprecated)</li>
			<li>Draft of AbortableMutex (and list things todo); 
			Lose lose qEVENT_GCCTHREADS_LINUX_WAITBUG, and fixed Event (WaitableEvent) class.

			ApplyUntilTrue, and ApplyUntilTrueStatic (use FindFirstThat).</li>
			<li>Major speed tweeks (Iterable::Apply/FindFirstThat, and things that use it, 
			and fix to String memory optimization qString_Private_BufferedStringRep_UseBlockAllocatedForSmallBufStrings).</li>

<ul>
	<li>renamed Stroika/Foundation/IO/Network/NetworkInterfaces.h to  Stroika/Foundation/IO/Network/LinkMonitor.h, and added new feature to monitor
		network connections, and used this to improve the stability / robustness of SSDP server support.
	</li>

	<li>Leveraging new IteratorOwner code, major backend-refactoring of how we manage patching of iterators
		associated with a container to fix a long standing bug (that iterators must be associated with originating owner
		to preseve proper semantics). That allowed fixing / cleaning up code in Tally<> - that had workarounds for this.
		(note - there was nothing special about Tally<> excpet that it was the first place I implemented sub-iterators,
		where you have an Elements and UniqueElements() iterable that were trivial wrappers on the original base iterator).
	</li>

	<li>Many refinements to SharedByValue code, including variadic template use to forward extra paraemters to Copy, and more sophisticated use of r-value references and noexcept.</li>

	<li>Started adding ...Iterators have a new owner (aka iterable/container) property and refined Equals() semantics</li>

	<li>Lots of cleanups of threads and signal handling code. Improved supression of abort. 
	Improved impl and docs on 'alertable' stuff for WinDoze. 
	thread_local with std::atomic/volatile.</li>
	
	<li>Significant cleanup of templates/containers - using 'using =' etc</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>	
New 'safe signals' mechanism. This is not widely used, but is used
in Services Framework, so users of the services framework (or anyone using safe signals)
should add:
<pre>
	Execution::SignalHandlerRegistry::SafeSignalsManager    safeSignals;
</pre>

to main(int argc, const char* argv[])
</li>

<li>Lose legacy nativive/pthread etc thread support (just C++-thread integration).</li>

<li>Use zlib 1.2.8</li>

<li>	
Experimental new ContainsWith() and EachWith()
</li>
